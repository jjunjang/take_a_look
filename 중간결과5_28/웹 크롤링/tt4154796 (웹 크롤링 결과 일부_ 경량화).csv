"There is no way that I could describe my emotions for this movie. I'm totally speechless. I haven't laughed (even cried) this much in Marvel movie or even in any movie. I'm fully on my emotion, there are so many tears of joy and loss. Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I love it more than 3000.Happiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement... I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this.It is such an experience you'll gonna remember it forever. People are clapping, laughing, crying, full of a state emotion. It's 3 hours long but it went by like a finger snapping by Thanos, and now I'm thinking I'm actually in Quantum Realm because it felt like 5 seconds. Even though you know where the story is gonna bring you because it's still a 'superhero movie' but it left me speechless. It's not just a superhero movie, it's more than that.Even some characters that you didn't like before, you will love them in this movie. Like Captain Marvel. I didn't like her before in her own movie but in Endgame they showed how powerful, how strong and how capable she really is. And now I kinda love her! But Marvel should really be careful of her line though, I didn't like some of her line like I'm the strongest and You didn't win because before you didn't have me duh. Also not gonna forget Hawkeye. To be honest, in Avengers I really didn't like Hawkeye because he's just a 'guy' with an arrow and just randomly showed up in any scene but actually he's character is so BADASS! Everything that we need, what we want is here.Also I don't get it why some people can not accept that Thor is fat or treat him like a joke. I mean, this movie might be trying to give us a message about no matter what 'shape' are you, you can be a hero and save the world. To be honest, I like what they did to Thor, that man is depressed and taking the most responsible after he missed the shot to kill Thanos in Infinity War. Even though he already did killed him but it's not gonna bring back his people of Asgard. Also he's God of Thunder for god sake, he could slap his stomach with thunder and got his abs back.I'm so happy too for Captain America. Finally he could do his dance with Peggy and I didn't expected that we could see the fight between Captain America with his own self. Also when Tony met his father really warm my heart, and we can see the 'real-life' Jarvis - I didn't expected that too.When the whole superhero arrived it is so EPIC! The whole person in theater are screaming and shocked. Gives me a goosebumps and still left me speechless!This movie is absolute perfection. The ending of this movie is we and the characters deserved. It gives a perfect balance for all these past 10 years. Epic and perfect ending, I was not disappointed at all. This movie was completely emotional and visually stunning. Now I get it why the Russo Brothers told us to do a Marvel Movie marathon before watching Endgame because this movie had everything to accomplish what left behind before all of this.Ready or not, whatever it takes.Go watch it for yourself."
	
"This is probably the highest 8/10 I could give for an 8/10 movie.There are some very good moments in Endgame and that's coming from a long standing MCU fan growing up with these movies. In creating an extensive and emotional journey for a lot of the MCU characters, it absolutely succeeds.Endgame ultimately is an excellent conclusion to over 10 years of film but I feel the plot's pacing and direction is really lacking to Infinity War, which 'trimmed the fat' and was much more focused and energetic. Granted, Endgame takes risks but this might be a disappointment to some fans with its slower pace that focuses on character development over action and intense sequences. The run time probably should be shorter or streamlined. Less cuts and motion blur during fight scenes would've made it easier to track fights as well.Respect for the Russo Brothers for taking the direction they did with Endgame and it really does satisfy but Infinity War is overall a more entertaining movie. It's not the best MCU movie but I can't dispute its great conclusion."
	
"If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews.
Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie."
	
"I have to say, my first reaction walking out of the cinema was that it was great. Probably an 8/10. You know there's so much fan service in this movie and I particularly loved the I can do this all day CA line from one CA to another. It was almost Toy Story 2, enlightened Buzz to naive Buzz banter.I loved Clever Hulk, found Thor hilarious, though a bit annoying at times, and loved the references to past movies. Cap swinging Mjollnir around was beautiful.The deaths in this movie were also pretty surprising but I agree with some of the more balanced reviews in here that it was bizarre that so much time was spent on Hawkeye - does anyone really care about him? Not really.Killing off Black Widow was a surprising touch, but I, like many others, probably felt more of an emotional reaction to Banner's relationship with her and not Hawkeye (because no one actually cares about him). Renner, as an actor, just doesn't cut it much, unfortunately.The real problem with End Game, is the time travel. I don't know why any movie franchise would ever want to deal with time travel knowing how much grief it creates. Sure they try to explain everything with their hilarious conversation about movies, but in the end, there are just too many questions left at the end of the day, particularly when they already try to explain it through the Ancient One.The most glaring one of these is, if they change the past, they're changing another timeline, so how selfish is that? If Tony Stark snaps his fingers and kills Thanos, what happens to that original timeline? If he sent Thanos and everyone back, how does he magically know not to send Gamora back who is now stuck in 2023 - and so does that mean 2014 Quill never meets Gamora?!? What the hell? Essentially erasing the entire 2014 GOTG franchise in that universe. If Captain America goes back in time, he will inevitably change history in some way or another, so that is another timeline, right? So while everyone else's timeline is meant to stay the same in the present (as said by Stark) how does Cap end up sitting by the same lake as everyone else.There are also way too many questions about new timelines created - but perhaps that is intentional, such as the Loki TV show. But this is why I hate it when they bring time travel into any movie and just add stuff to it to make it wrap up nicely in their own universe.Also, don't get me started on how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn't stop Thor's Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.I also think Marvel made a serious mistake creating Captain Marvel, how is she brought in as a convenient deus ex machina and yet doesn't really stick around to show off all her abilities, and she can't even defeat Thanos single handedly? Pfft. That was rich. She can barely prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers, yet in Infinity War, Cap was able to actually hold off his hand too? Bizarre parallels.So okay, sure, it was enjoyable to watch, but I just feel that there are too many plot inconsistencies creeping into End Game. There should have been better ways to get the infinity stones back, and I think someone stupid just thought time travel was the best way to do it,."
	
"I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.I loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure.I respect how they were prepared to show the consequences of what Thanos had done but by killing him off so quickly and then them having to do their own stone quest (hadn't we already seen Thanos doing this in IW) it felt slow and lazy. Worse still was that it felt very self-indulgent and attempting to be clever for clever sake.Like how Back to the Future II considered itself clever for showing the events of the first film but with Marty flitting around behind the scenes to ensure that it all still happened. I know it's meant to be fan pleasing but it really felt like a gimmick and lacking in confidence. Almost like it was saying 'Hey guys, this will make you smile'. If you want to make me smile, concentrate on maintaining the quality of your product rather than directly trying to make me like you.But the trouble with messing around with timelines and bouncing around is that it makes the audience start asking questions during the film. The linearity that we'd seen in IW and the imminent fast approaching threat is replaced in Endgame with a lack of direction and characters that are earlier versions of who the audience have seen.In IW we were shown Thanos. He was written to be sympathetic or at least a character that we the audience could understand. He believed in what he was doing and this made him more rounded. But in Endgame, that version is dispatched quickly and we are supplied with a 2014 (?) Thanos who isn't the character we know but is just a token bad guy.This Thanos hasn't made the sacrifice at Vormire, he isn't the guy that would empathise with Scarlet Witch for what she did to Vision. He has suddenly become a token cut out evil bad guy that needs to be defeated. Hell, the writers even manage to forget their own time loop by saying that this Thanos has learnt that he doesn't want to wipe out 50% anymore because they are too ungrateful. How does he know this when the 2014 Thanos has only just literally arrived in the post wipeout Universe? How has he had time to form the opinion that his previous quest for a 50% cull isn't worthy?Is this a case of the writers being terrified that they had created a bad guy that people related to or was it a fear that they'd written themselves into a hole? Why go to the effort of creating that character in IW to suddenly kill him off at the beginning of Endgame just for a dramatic punch?For me, the time travelling and stone gathering wasted time to create unimportant scenes that fundamentally undermine the films that came before.
In my opinion it would have been better if they had shown the remaining Avengers preparing to do some Avenging and maintained the single minded linearity of IW of battling towards and reaching a post click Thanos and somehow reversing his work.The more I think of the film, the more plot holes and frustrations manifest themselves. Thor's drinking and man child antics might have been initially funny but one begins to realise that they are deliberately doing this to clip his wings. Likewise with Hulk, his primordial desire to smash and destroy has been removed to think it out and he has become an embarrassing shadow of his former self.The thing that is meant to be amazing about the MCU is the world building but inconsistencies have been appearing and there are so many in Endgame that it makes you question whether these two films are written by the same people.In IW, Thanos is a dangerous and credible threat because he has the infinity stones. He takes on half of the Avengers, Strange and some of the Guardians on Titan and smashes them and then takes on the other half on Wakanda and smashes them. Yet it is Stormbreaker (whose creation we have seen been hard earned by a motivated Thor) that has the power to take down Thanos even when he has a full complement of Infinity Stones.Yet we roll forward to Endgame and we have literally all the good guys together in one place, Cap with his shield, Tony fully powered up, Scarlet Witch p*ssed and vengeful, Capt Marvel who can seemingly do anything and Thor wielding both Mjolnir AND Stormbreaker and Thanos NOT in possession of the gauntlet, yet they can't defeat him.It's like the fights in IW were so amazing because the good guys were taking on an unbeatable foe yet here he is now seemingly defeatable by the 'rules' that the writers established . A good example of this would be in IW when Cap is the last man standing before Scarlet Witch and he grabs the gauntlet. You see the look of admiration/respect on Thanos' face that Cap is holding open the gauntlet before he punches him to the ground yet now that scene seems pointless.The writers for Endgame seem to have been driven to undo everything they did in IW. All the tension, all the sacrifice, all the development of Thanos discarded for well, I don't know what. It makes no sense.IW had two incredible scenes that used to choke me up. When Cap appears in the train station, the Avengers theme kicks in and Falcon and Widow take down the henchman in a wonderfully choreographed scene. In just that one scene it shows them coming to the rescue, it shows how intuitively they work together and it showcases their heroism.Likewise when Thor creates Stormbreaker and makes his entrance on Wakanda, I felt it for the journey that Thor has been on. He's had to contend with loss and defeat and humiliation and this is his redemption. Here is a character that has earned his game changing weapon and when he arrives and demands to face a character that everyone else is running away from, I want to punch the air.But in Endgame, that feels like it has to be corrupted. We can't have Thor being dominant, let's break him and make him a fool. We can't have Thanos being complicated and relatable, let's make him a cut out bad guy. We can't have Hulk being rage fuelled and smashing stuff up, let's make him more sensitive and talking stuff out. We can't have Cap being stoic and heroic, let's have him ridiculing one of his own iconic lines in a silly gimmicky fight with himself and commenting on his butt. We can't have a powerful female character that we're invested in look sexy AND be able to take down Thanos, let's give Scarlet Witch a small part but focus our attention on a female character that hasn't earnt our admiration or desire for revenge.To be honest, the 'rules of engagement' had been set so well in IW that when in Endgame Thanos massed his ranks against the Avengers and then ALL of the good guys showed up, I was almost expecting the camera to pull away and not show the fight given that it was so obviously going to be an easy win for the good guys.And as for the big fight scene, it did reek of what DC always manage to do which is just throw everything into an end battle and bludgeon you with CGI and pyrotechnics so that you aren't really sure what is going on.In the many fights in IW, you knew what was going on, you recognised the combatants, you understood the stakes and you identified the geography of the scene. In Endgame we got one big massive fight where everything was thrown in the pot and it was just assumed by the directors that we would be happy with all the flashing lights.
And I have to say that considering that Steve and Tony fell out so hard, and that Tony's criticism of Steve was so unfair, that I really had hoped for more than just a handshake, a muttering of 'no worries' and 'here's your shield'. These guys wrote and directed Civil War, they created the line 'we fell out hard' and hence I had hoped for something deeper and more touching than a handshake.Steve wrote Tony a letter telling him that when he needed him he'd be there but once again the Iron Man bias had to creep in and once again Tony was the victim and the ultimate hero.But I think my biggest problem is how the convenient time travelling undermines everything. When a franchise starts retrofitting stuff (like Fury's eye being from a space cat), it's then hard to consider the previous stories.Having 2014 Gamorra means that all the evolution that we saw her go through in GOTG 1 and 2 is wasted. Having Cap marry Peggy means the pain of his sacrifice, him seeing her in Winter Soldier when she is suffering from Alzheimer's, hell even his blossoming relationship with Sharon Carter is kinda irrelevant. Having seen Thor at last step away from his two weaker origin films into the entertainment of Ragnarok and the redemption in IW leaves us now with a bumbling buffoon.We know that what makes Captain America what he is, is the serum that makes him a super soldier. That he was transformed from a weakling to a superhuman. Sam Wilson is not a super soldier and he didn't take the serum. He is Falcon. Now maybe in the comics he becomes Cap but Bucky is a super soldier. Is the new Cap going to foil an evil plot and be defeated with a tazer or a knife to the chest? Consider the beatings that Steve has taken and the physical strength that he has shown we can recognise that Sam Wilson does not have that.I'm sorry to say but the Russo's have dropped the ball. Themselves and their writers have succumbed to their success and their desire to be engineers of political correctness and social change. I thought Endgame would be the high soaring end to this 10 year run of impressive movie entertainment but in the end the writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product for a chance to 'educate' us all. A real shame and a wasted opportunity.Infinity War is clearly the highlight of the last 10 years but even now I fear that repeated viewings will render it pointless considering how the makers decided to fundamentally damage it."
	
"Unpopular opinion.
Let me start by saying that Endgame is not a bad film. In fact it was a decent film. But nothing more. Maybe I was expecting a masterpiece like Infinity War due to all this hype.
The first 2 hours of the movie are really boring. They try to build up many emotional moments only to destroy them with a joke the next minute. And there are really MANY jokes that feel out of place.
Endgame uses the previous marvel movies to give you a good story, without building it itself. It's like the writers didn't care to give us a proper story. They just filled it with many dramatic moments. Also, there was no action in the first 120 minutes.
Plus, I did not like the way they treated Thor at all. They made him a comic relief in the worst way possible. I wonder how Thor fans feel after watching this.
The last battle was epic and beautiful but that's all I really enjoyed. The cgi was top notch.
Also, the way they ended Cap's story, meh... Yeah we got it, you want to make people cry and give us the end of an era, but at least do it without creating dozens of plot holes.
The 3 hours went by fast, but I wouldn't watch it again in theaters (I had planned to watch it at least 1 more time).
This could be so damn good... Disappointed.*edit* Also, all of you fanboys who downvote all my reviews because you got angry because I gave your beloved Avengers a 6, you are just amusing and pathetic. Get a life."
	
"First of, Infinity War was the greatest MCU movie ever made IMHO.Of course, following it up was never going to be easy, and it's sheer greatness and the impact of the 'snap' was something that the Russos just couldn't navigate a way out of. However, plot difficulties aside, there was really no excuse for some of the poor character treatment and pacing issues that they had.Positives:
RDJ's actingNatasha and Hawkeye's last interactionsCGINegatives:
Abysmally poor treatment of Thor, reduced to a comic relief sideshowAbysmally poor treatment of the Hulk - One of the strongest characters of the MCU didn't fight more than 10secs in the 2 supposedly landmark movies of the MCU??Completely ruined Thanos - reduced to a caricature 'bad guy' after an excellently built character in IWPoor re-introduction of the vanished Avengers - seems most of the team wasn't even paid and they just used some stock footage from previous movies for their blink and you miss appearancesWasted potential of Capt Marvel - why introduce a character so powerful, and then not use them for >95% of the movie?Pacing - all over the place. Could easily have trimmed the fat and achieved a much more coherent productMore of a Cap+Stark movie than an Avengers movie.Time travel plotholes - hellloooo. I was OK with the main plan of stealing, snapping, restoring the stones. Hell, I am even OK with Cap getting the happy ending (assuming he stays in hiding his entire life and Carter's life decisions are not affected by the guy in her basement). But as soon as Thanos goes to the future and dies there, Uh Oh - did we just lose the entire Infinity War?? Maybe I am too dumb to understand this...In the end, while the homage to the movies and characters was fine, I really wanted to have a movie I would rush to watch again (Like I did with IW). Sadly, they couldn't deliver this time."
	
"After Infinity War I had huge expectations. Unfortunately I think it doesn't follow the comic book at all because they wanted some kind of closure of the story.
I saw a lot of 10 star reviews and I cannot believe the majority of people like this movie more than Infinity War.
I'm not saying it wasn't entertainment to watch but the feeling is that all heroes were forced to fit in a movie paying a big price to the story.
There are moments in the movie where the rules from all other Marvel movies are broken and characters which were build over hours of screen time were reduced in order to make space for others.
The story is average at best with big flaws."
	
Absolute perfection end game !! Good acting performance to all the characters. Great cgi's. Truly epic & perfect ending to a long journey of marvel movie. Go see it you wont regret it !! Perfection Marvel Endgame !!
	
The best superheroes movie a end of era for marvel was very good
	
"A nice production for those only interested in action sequences but not so great for those wanting closure of the Marvel story line...The best part of the film is that it brings together all previous Marvel movies to drive the plot... And the worst part of the film is it brings together all previous marvel movies to drive the plot... because it seems the production team don't really know the stories that ran before...
Anyone who follows the stories (from the movies, not the comic) will know there are much easier time points to collect each of the stones... The drama created by making this 'collection plan' much more difficult than it needed to be, added at least an unnecessary hour to the movie...Other plot points that didn't sit well with me and reduced the enjoyment of the movie, are...1) Thanos 'killed' 50% of the good guys and he's hailed as a super villain... Tony 'killed' 100% of the bad guys and he's a hero? Don't heroes learn from their own pain and sufferings and on principal refuse to inflict the same misery on others?Surely, other than Thanos and a few of his more loyal subjects, the rest are simply following orders...
(On another tangent, Thanos seems to really believe in his cause because after he killed off half the universe, including his people I believe, he lived alone and not with an army of servants and subjects for him to rule as a king... That's honourable...)2) they didn't reverse time... Just brought everyone back with a 5 year time gap... People should not behave normally when loved ones they haven't been with for 5 years suddenly reappear... Those who have survived those 5 years didn't get their memories and aging removed, right?3) how did Thanos and his gang all time travel while the avengers are so calculative about one person 2 trips?A 30 second segment showing Thanos instructing his people to mass produce the Pym solution for time travel would have closed this plot hole.4) always disliked Captain Marvel because she is so powerful that no other super heros need to exist...
And still... She is so concerned about other worlds that she couldn't be bothered to be present for the start of the biggest battle her home planet is about to face... when every known superhero showed up at the right time and right place...And later, the battle actually showed she's not all that great... So her weakness is she sweats the small stuff, can't see the big picture and not available/functional when needed?4) If they can bring back Gamora, why can't they find a timeline to bring back Natasha and even Tony? Superheros really don't like to plan and think things through... (Same as when they don't seek the easiest points to retrieve the stones... With zero time pressure for planning...)5) speaking of Gamora, the Gamora who came with Thanos don't know the guardian crew at all... so even though she's not 'evil' like the old Nabula, she wouldn't be friendly like she knows they are the 'good guys'...
Based on the time line, she doesn't even know Quill yet... So she should view him and them as the enemy in the battle...6) Nabula... If she killed her historic self, shouldn't she just drop dead in the new timeline?
Grandfather paradox anyone?7) what's with that special scene where all the women heroes joined together to show their power?
To me, that's totally sexist...Speaking for myself, I enjoy male and female superheros for their individual powers and weaknesses... Once a person reaches superhero status, in my mind, they crease to represent a gender (other than those gender/age stereotypes to generate laughs and endearment...)Having al female scene shows me that the production team are so hung up on being politically correct that they generate a reverse sexist scene to feel they are all inclusive... Sigh...
These same people want a female James Bond / Indiana Jones but not a male Mary Poppins / Eliza Doolittle... And they think the rest of the world is sexist...
The self proclaimed tolerant and inclusive are starting to paint themselves into a corner...8) while it's nice to see Bruce and the Hulk getting along...an unangry Hulk takes away what makes the Hulk a character...Remember these famous words? You wouldn't like me when I'm angry... that's gone now... Sigh...9) speaking of which... Why on earth would the Hulk go into battle in an amour suit? Surely that was made for Bruce when the Hulk refused to come out to play?How would the Hulk fit inside and why would he need it? That's taking power away from the Hulk and it pissed me off...10) if the Ancient One knows and sees all possibilities... Even knowing when Dr Strange will show up... How did she not see the Hulk coming to ask for the stone?11) Loki's escape with the tesseract surely would have spun an alternate time line... Since there is only ONE tesseract... Then much of the previous stories wouldn't really make sense if Loki had it almost immediately after he lost it ...12) Captain America basically anointed the Falcon to be the next Capt? *Roll eyes*...I think the Falcon already has a lot going and Bucky should be a better successor...
In any case, we won't see Thor succeed the iron Man suit because he doesn't really need the extra edge...
Bucky is a super soldier in the same vein as the Capt. And should have been his first choice for a successor...13) did Captain America just ignore world events for the last century while he hid with Peggy? (& what did he do after she died... Surely she can't live as long as he... Wouldn't he simply come back to the 'present' having enjoyed a full and loving life, and not yet as old as he became?) ... The Production team might wish to rewatch Highlander...😋He never got the itch to help the 'current' Captain America fight injustice? He resisted the urge to pass on information that might help the avengers as he had lived through all the events before? (I know, I know... Can't/shouldn't change history... But how could he resist, for someone like him who loves to lecture and lead?)14) the biggest plot hole of all and the one that buried the movie for me... is...The Thanos that was in the battle came from before the previous movie right? (Infinity war)...If Tony Stark kills Thanos in this movie... That means none of the previous movie plot could have happened... Nobody was killed off (not even Loki...)... Nobody lost/gained 5 years of their lives... Thor didn't need to get fat, none of this movie should even get started...That's the devil when idiot film makers dabble with time travel in a non-time-travel movie... Adding this means they can't take care of the details properly...The above are just the main plot annoyances... And there and many other smaller ones which prevented a truly epic movie experience...3 hours is a long movie and much of it unnecessary if they tightened the plot to make more sense...So, while the movie is good...I wouldn't selectively watch it again... Which to me is the benchmark of a great movie.I'm torn in giving a rating... I want to give 7 based on the scale of the production and emotional ties it has on me from all the previous Marvel movies...But the constant I'm jolted with throughout the film killed much of my buzz and for that I want to give it a 2... Sto be fair... it'll get a 4 overall to balance both sides..."
	
"So it all ends. I have loved most of the MCU, some have been too predictable but I awaited after IW to see how it would all pan out. Firstly some of my favourite characters are a joke. Please don't dumb Thor or Banner/Hulk down, not necessary. Great starting scene, then slow dramatic next 1.5 hours. It builds to the time travel reversing all section with too many plot holes. We've all seen other time reversing movies who have done it so much better. The last hour is spectacular, great to see all the gang back but it feels rushed. Emotion runs high and defo not a kids film in my eyes. Cap is great Stark is amazing but everyone else feels like there just there. What I loved was the beauty of the final scenes, wonderful score and saying goodbye to old friends. Overall wanted more, but even far from perfect is still pretty good."
	
Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.
	
"To be honest, most of the people i talked to about this movie said that endgame was great, fantastic or incredible. None of these people could have answered the question: why is this a good movie?.
In the half of the playtime i was bored and already wondering, that they needed another hour and a half to tell the story behind this.
I don' t want to spoiler anything and i'll remain quiet until the movie's airing is completed. But once you have seen it, please try to answer this simple question: why was this a good movie to you?"
	
"Unbelievable. For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many. I don't want to spoil anything. Watch it!"
	
"I have given a lower rating to this movie in the context of a follow up to infinity war. I cannot believe the hype and positive critical reviews given to this movie. There are some glaring plot holes that just cannot be ignored like
Steve Rogers going back in time and preferring to live an ordinary life with Peggy Carter and never being Captain America!
The God of Thunder and the big angry Hulk being reduced to a laughing stock.
The supporting villains seem to have absolutely no impact whatsoever rendering them redundant. and finally
Thanos - the most refreshing and complex characters of IW being reduced to a generic villain.
Robert Downing Junior is the one saving grace of the movie."
	
"I'm not even sure where to start. I had high expectations ever since I've walked out from IW premiere. Those expectations are further fueled up by all the good reviews and 10/10 ratings this movie received. But, after watching a movie, I'm quite sure that all those reviews and ratings have been sponsored. There is no other explanation. I've also heard stories about people crying, laughing and cheering throughout the movie and giving standing ovations after the movie ended. I'm not sure are those stories made up or what, but in theater where I was, we had like two laughs, some WTFs, multiple yawns and not much else. As matter a fact, I've never seen so many people playing with their phones during a Marvel movie. Never ever. It was that boring.Now, don't get me wrong, the movie is somewhat watchable, but I beleive the fans deserved much more than watchable for this final installment of the franchise. I could basically write a book about what's wrong with this movie, but won't as I've already spend too much time on this abomination. What's the use of it anyway. Fanboys will praise this movie no matter what and disregard all the arguments against it. Movie creators are already counting all the billions they've earned by breaking every box office record there is. The only victims here are the true fans who actually appreciate Stan Lee's life work, but they probably already share my opinion anyway. I will, however, throw down a few things that ruined this movie for me, just so I can take it off my chest.Action balance is terrible. In the first 2 hours, basically nothing happens and what does happen makes no sense. There is almost no action and the storyline is all over the place. And then, all of a sudden the whole hell breaks loose. That wouldn't be so bad if the final batlle was spectacular as it should be, but it wasn't. It was a 15 minutes of pure chaos and CGI showcase. It wasn't clear who does what, who fights who... no coreography, no signature moves... nothing.Screen time balance was terible as well. I understand the idea to focus on the original avengers squad, but that's not the reason to give like 90% of the screen time to them (with addition of Ant-man) and like 10% to other 50 characters in the MCU. Basically, no one got more than 60 seconds of total screen time, including Captain Marvel who supposed to be a big part of the movie. With most characters, it felt more like a slide show of cameos, rather than integral part of the story.Most of the characters from the original avengers squad are ruined. I understand that they needed to close their story arc somehow, but was this the right way? Should it be this anti-climactic? Captain America turning into a grandpa? Mighty Hulk becoming clumsy scientest who won't even fight anymore? I kid you not, he didn't throw a single punch the entire move. He basically became the most useless character in MCU. Thor becoming a fat, depressed alcoholic who plays Fortnite and argues with kids on the Internet? Really? The god of thunder? Black Widow meeting the most anti-climactic end imaginable? Couldn't she at least have one more fight scene with her signature moves as we've seen in some previous MCU movies? Couldn't Hulk have at least one more Hulk Smash moment? Couldn't Hawkeye show off his archery skills once again? Shouldn't they go with a bang? They deserved it and the fans deserved it.Why there is no consistency with most character's powers. I mean, at one moment it looks like Captain Marvel can destroy Thanos and his entire army all by herself, but the next one she looks like a houswive who can be thrown around by her drunk husbend with a bad attitude. The same goes for Scarlett Witch. Also, it looks like any character has more chance to win when fighting Thanos alone than they do when going 10 on one. Just makes no sense.Everything looks rushed up. The main story is all over the place. The entire time travel plot is a mess. Fight scenes are not coreographed well, so it's difficult to follow what's going on most of the time. There is no character development. They just pop up out of nowhere. Humor is forced and out of the place most of the time.I guess the movie creators just wanted to add too much into this movie, but achieved quite the opposite result. Anyway, the best course of action would be to rename this move to Iron man 4 and create another Avengers movie, but do it properly this time."
	
"I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ending of the Avenger Movies.
I will watch it again and again and again. 10 points well deserved!!!"
	
"I actually enjoyed Infinity War very much. The best part of that movie was the villain Thanos. He wasn't just another baddie. He clearly had a complex (and intelligent) character and the audience could associate with some of his ideas and philosophy. That interesting complexity and dialogue that he brought to the table was absent or minimal in this movie.This movie was disappointing because of:1) Thanos' portrayal2) Minor characters like Hawkeye given way too much screen time.3) Thor and Hulk never snapped back to their old great selves (was waiting for it but it didn't happen). I actually enjoyed fat Thor and found it funny but was disappointed we did not get to see classic Thor by the end, even for a moment.4) Captain Marvel clearly had too much power and could have almost single-handedly dealt with Thanos. It felt like the writers just gave the most paper thin excuse to keep her away.5) In Infinity War one actually felt sad when Spider Man perished in Iron Mans arms. I felt something deeply profound with the ending scene in Infinity War when Thanos could finally sit and rest to watch the sun set over the new universe he had created. The emotional scenes and deepness in this movie were just not at the same level.6) The time-travel and quantum physics scenes were confusing or at best not well explained (and I say that as someone with a PhD in Astrophysics!).7) The last fight scene seemed to be a (cheaper) copy of the Infinity War scene.Personally I would give Infinity War a 8.5 and Endgame around a 6. However, seeing how many people are (ridiculously, in my opinion) giving this a 10, to try restore some semblance of balance, I will give it a 1."
	
"Like many others, I was excited for this movie following the end of Infinity Wars. I let my mind wander with all the elaborate plot predictions, new characters revealed, epic battles and an emotional thread bringing it all together that infinity wars did so well.What I got was a good movie, rushed with minimal character development and what left me hoping for an extended cut when the movie comes to the small screen.Thanos, such a complex character walking the tightrope of his moral compass in infinity wars, was suddenly a megalomaniac hell bent on destruction of all. Thor, given character by ragnarok and purpose by infinity wars, was completely trivialised into a humorous side character. Hulk was lazily reduced to a new hybrid version of Professor Hulk with little explanation why. And when all the dead characters came back it was just accepted and let's get on with it.This movie had the potential to be a real emotional roller coaster but they blew it, rushed through he serious moments in an effort to play homage to the previous films (which I felt was a great touch though). The sequences of events in getting the stones just seemed a hastily put together series of interactions that needed more depth.Then finally, the battle - I was excited when I looked at my watch and realised we had over na hour left in the film. Then disappointed when it effectively ended 15 minutes later.I think this should have been split into two movies - the first an emotional journey into the past, reuniting heroes with their origin stories and showing how far they had come while bringing each deceased hero back with appropriate fanfare. The second, the right level of preparation, battlecries and depth to make a modern epic.I still enjoyed it and need to watch again, probably when it's released to on demand. But the excitement I had from the hyped reviews quickly evaporated. Interested to see what the consensus is in a few weeks. My consensus, missed opportunity."
	
"This movie was an hour and a half too long! The first half of the movie was slow and uninteresting. It did improve as it went along but was unnecessarily long and carried on with so much non sense that was not essential to the plot.
Another example of an over hyped film doing well at the box office because of a big budget and star power. It is marginally better than the last Avengers movie but still mediocrity at its best."
	
"Boring and slow at the start.The writing wasn't great. Come on, using time travel to fix everything. Iron took literally no time at all to figure out the chaotic of the quantum realm. Thanos had the gauntlet, becomes a god, yet he could not foresee the future (that they will go back in time?) come on, he had the time stone.Captain marvel was in the movie for like 5 minutes...Captain america is so OP at the end.Need to have less of Captain America and Iron man, they are boring characters with the same hate/love relationship. Needed more scene of Thor and Hulk (these two really lighten up the mood of the movie).The army battle at the end was over the top and had really no purpose. Who needs an army when you have Thor + Hulk + Captain marvel. Captain Marvel took no effort at all taking out their mother ship.Thanos, a character who is patience and always prepare/plan ahead yet he wanted to start a fight with the avengers from the future. He had no stones (just a weapon) and he fought head on with the avengers who already gather all the stones. Why risk it? Yes some would argue that he was over confident and that he thought none of the Avengers can use the gauntlet (they have a Hulk and Thor!). Thanos should have just waited till they return the stones...then take the stones then. Or he could have stop the future avengers from gathering the stones in the first place. Just bad writing.And the ending, come on, Captain America manages to find and live through the same timeline and meeting up with the future Bucky and Falcon (what is the chance of this? 1 in 14 millions? The writers set rules for time travel, yet they end it like this. Just really unbelievable.Most people I spoke to said they enjoyed the movie for the fun of it. They liked the action...etc. Yet when I asked them did the movie make sense? Most of them replied no or kinda.I felt they were trying to do too much and in the process left people like me wondering...that made no sense..."
	
"Worst Marvel Movie ever!
The screen is mostly crowded with people who are adding no character or value to the scenes.
Waste of Thor and Hulk. Ironman is gone.
Marvel is going to struggle without these guys who were responsible for all the success they've had. Poor decision making and it's going to cost them heavy!!!"
	
All i can say is for us Thor fans this movie was the ultimate slap in the face. apart from a couple scenes that shone...the rest was absolute garbage. i can comfortably say Infinity war was way better and garbage is a movie im 100% sure i will never watch again in my life. And Ive never said that about a movie. Dont believe the hype and don't waste your money.
	
"Infinity wars was really good and I was looking forward to see the continuation (end games), I went very excited to the movies to watch this movie and I was completely disappointed.
First of all why the corny comedy? Why destroying the reputation of the heroes, Thor is now an out of shape dirty alcoholic and the Hulk is now a hybrid Sissy who is scared to fight, he is not what he used to be, he is just a pathetic corny character.
Most of the movie is just Blah, Blah, Blah, ridiculous time travel and corny all the way.
I used to love Marvel movies, but after this transformation to corny comedy I don't think I will want to see another Marvel movie.
Stan Lee must be really disappointed in heaven or wherever he is.
They killed the franchise, it is character defamation, if I was Thor or the Hulk I would sue the director of this movie."
	
None of the rules presented in movie makes sense. Bad movie in regards to final conclusion
	
Meh...could have made better use of the superheroes
	
"Too long, too boring, too many special effects versus substance.
Bad jokes Don't don't waste your money or time."
	
"Well first off, Infinity War is one of my favourite movies of all time, and I feel the expectations I had built from that, has impacted how I feel about this movie.Their are some really beautiful scenes and some great fan service which deserves a mention, in a movie that feels like a stepping stone to promote some of the characters that recently failed in the comics. We are entering the get woke, go broke phase of the MCUNow onto the movie:The plot line is all over the place and they made the mistake of using time travel to fix the universes problems, there are no consequences for failure anymore in the mcu, because just like in Dragon all we can just Wish back all those who died. Its basically Back To The Future, the Thanos edition.Once again, they sideline Thor and The Hulk by using them purely as a punchline for lame, low IQ jokes in a corny script that feels like it is trying to be so many things, but doesn't quite hit the mark. Thor spends the entire movie as a whiny, fat child with mommy issuesAlthough there were some very nice, touching moments to the movie I feel like most of the mourning and brooding could have been condensed into a montage in order for us to see the heroes do, exactly what we came to see the heroes do, fight bad guys. There's very little in the way of action and because the story was so all over the place, I left feeling like nothing was actually accomplished in this movie.As always Tony is amazing, throwing out one liners and nicknames and Captain America is great too.Overall I really enjoyed many aspects of it, but at the same time I felt like there was no control over the plot. Like they were more concerned with paying homage to EVERY character ever, before writing a great narrative."
	
"I will write this review as a way to unload how frustrated I feel after watching this movie.First and foremost, Tony Stark's plan to bring everyone back after a 5 year gap is absurd and selfish. After 5 years you should be able to balance the choice of leaving everything as it is OR going back and changing everything back to how it was. Keep in mind 5 years is a very long time to have been pronounced dead. The paperwork to bring these people back into the system and the burden they will now be on the economy and Social Security, at least for a while, would be enough to bankrupt a nation. Conveniently, all MCU's family and friends were either fine or they had all vanished together so having them come back unharmed, albeit 5 years later, is a relief. That is not likely the case for the rest of the world though. Most of the people coming back are coming back to a drastically changed world. Most will be homeless, they have no jobs, no way of getting a job, not soon enough, anyway. Some will have lost family members and beloved pets during that time, to old age, suicide, accidents and all sorts of natural causes. And some, if not most, will be coming back to a world that moved on without them. Their loved ones may have already found others or have been changed so drastically that they're strangers now. If you watched Tom Hank's Cast Away and recall his hopelessness after coming back to life to find his house sold, his insurance cashed, his job taken, his industry changed, his wife remarried... Now multiply that by half of the Universe's life forms and you have an unmitigated tragedy of cosmic proportions. All so that Tony gets to keep his 4-year-old?
No. Tony Stark's toughest choice should have been that. Am I willing to sacrifice my daughter to save half the life in the Universe? After that, snapping your fingers knowing you will die should be a piece of cake.And then the time travel ordeal... If the operating theory is that you cannot change the past then you should be unable to change the past, PERIOD. The only things that can happen are the things that have already happened. In that scenario, it is plausible to assume you'll be able to go back in time, steal the Infinity Stones unnoticed and then but them back... But all of this is only possible IF they have already happened. Complicated yet theoretically possible. You can even justify Thor's conversation with his mom or the Ancient One's chat with Banner because we were unaware that these things had already happened then, even if it is our first time seeing it. But then you have the Cap fighting with himself and telling other's he's with Hydra, Loki's escape and the cap moving back to the past to grow old together with his long lost love. You could argue that the Cap made himself forget the fight with the scepter and lived secretly in a basement for the rest of his life, but REALLY? And what about all the undercover Hydra operatives that will soon find that the Cap is not really on their side and hence must know of their own involvement and what about Loki? How was he still a prisoner for the end scene in Avengers when Thor escorts him back to Assgard and where he is later seen in prison? And how are we reconstructing the Tesarract and putting the Ether back into Natalie Portman? Or CAN you change the past after all? So why not do the unthinkable and kill one baby (Thanos) to save half the Universe? Send Hawkeye and Black Widow to do it. Why not travel in time to beat Thanos at Wakanda, now with the help of the entire team, including all of the dispersed heroes and Captain Marvel? Or did we just create 6 different alternate realities and timelines but somehow feel good about our victory in just this one? And is the Cap comfortable going back to 1945, hanging his shield and watching history unfold without altering a single thing, knowing full well all the lives he could've saved (think Vietnam, Kennedy, 9/11, etc.)?And how does every single main character survive the final battle? They blew the Avengers headquarters to smithereens yet they're all somehow unscathed sub-level 20, just brushing off the dust. Or when Thanos made it rain fire? I get some are meta-humans but others have latex suits and some body armor, nothing more. How are there not more casualties?I could've lived with Thor's beer-belly, the new Hulk and the rest of the idiotic jokes if the movie itself weren't a joke already. The logic seems off and I am just thinking about this now. These people had 10 years to write a better story. The movie was made painfully long because of gaping plot holes rather than by great writing."
	
"I am a huge sci-fi fan. I really like marvel movies but not a MCU person. If you liked all MCU movies and are a marvel fan don't read anymore just go see it, I'm sure you'll love it. I have to admit Infinity wars was a very good movie and easily re-watchable. I was very upset at the ending and the twisting of spiderman dying. Now spoilers (duh).
What I didn't like
(1) 2 hours and 40 minutes of dialog and 20 minutes of cheesy CGI.
(2) Thanos please shut up. Please, you talk way tfm.
(3) Woke much. Blacktain America. Power Puff Girls, CA therapy new age session
(4) Captain Marval is way too powerful, why do we even need the avengers?
(5) So predictable but you knew I was going to say that.
(6) Time Travel sucks but what are you going to do over and over again.
(7) Thor belly gut funny for 1 minutes, then super sad.
(8) I was dragged to this movie by my kids
(9) RDJ got like 100M for this stupid thing. Girls, Shmirls...hiding under a bar
(10) Comedy was terrible. Only 2 jokes I liked.
(11) Drama Queen Thanos gets two deaths?
(12) I feel bad for Peter Quill. Gomarah was resurrected but doesn't know him.What I liked
(1) Go eat a salad...great line.
(2) Tony Stark meeting his father. Very heartwarming. Only nice moment."
	
"Had high expectations for this movie, but is was the worst =("
	
"What's up with the time travel?
The OA also dig into this kind of multiverse travel, but clearly they did it better and try their best not to put tons of plot holes into their film, but clearly the director of Endgame decided to ignore it. Seems like their fan base forgot their brain when they watch this too based on the ridiculously high rating of this movie."
	
"Really disappointed after watching it yesterday. Unnecessarily long, very boring finish to a series of movies with a lot of peaks (Ragnarock, GotG, CaptA) and quite a few troughs (AoU, Iron Man generally, Black Panther) but I thought this was a new low. Really poor writing, idiotic plot holes and stupid action scenes. Really sad end.. felt like flogging a dead horse, shame to go out like this."
	
"What can I say the title says it all, the director is really screwed up with the hulk he didn't even have a decent fight scene. The story it was kind of boring also fell asleep practically in the middle of the movie. This movie felt like a Hollywood director made it instead of a real fan the way it should have been made. And the CGI was horrible"
	
"Expected a lot more honestly. Infinity War was way better. After they make out the plan, everything is predictable."
	
"What happens when every one of the millionth characters pretend to be important? They're all plain flat.Felt for 3 hours that my job was taking care of the cctv of the busiest Black Friday store, where a huge crowd fight for nothing and eventually someone gets something of value.Dr Strange creates the cheese holes out of the blue to fight Thanos... pathetic reaction of the audience seeing Black Panther come into action.... predictable and pointless. Effectist, I'm sure. A movie for hopeless generations needing to be represented by a super-tag.Once the dream was to have super powers, fly, move things, you name it.Not it is to feel represented by the person who does it. Enter Black Panther and Captain Marvel.Marcel studios monetising on social movements. How lame is your life to need that representation in an action movie? It's a story of them, not a story of you!I saw a long cctv recording."
	
"This movie was pure trash, it was slow and lacking, it didn't have the climax that the Infinity war had. The male characters took all the spotlight throughout the entire movie. Captain Marvel barely had any limelight in the movie. Poor Natasha Romanov, the way she died, to me was very unfair, and Hawkeye became a rogue criminal, killing innocent people just because his family was gone.Really, like he was the only one loosing a family! In the other hand, Thanos was nothing but a dull villain with no solid purpose whatsoever.The plot was too rushed. One other thing was I didn't like how the Russo's brothers portrayed The Hulk in Endgame. I thought he was going to have a rematch with Thanos after loosing to him in Infinity war. A fat Thor! are you kidding me Marvel, one of the most powerful avengers and you made this guy look like the god of mommy issues! I tell you there were too many flaws in this movie. At the end I have to admit Deadpool was right, I don't want to see another Avengers movie."
	
"*Packed with MANY spoilers*Let's get real. This movie was so massive, but it has sooo many plotholes! Make no mistake I love Marvel, but this movie was not the best that's out there from the MCU. I loved how the movie pays homage to the previous films, I thought that was quite clever. But I personally expected way more action earlier in the movie.Thanos snapped half the universe in IW. But we didn't really get to SEE the direct impact on Earth in this movie. No chaos. No news. Just a ... quiet depressed world? Really? I wanted to feel anxious and feel like all hope is lost but it never really got there. Even during collecting the stones from the previous timelines.The attack on Thanos in the opening scene was lame. This guy was meant to be a massive villain that the MCU has been building up for a decade, and his death was over in minutes. Captain Marvel's lack of screen time didn't make any sense, she's so powerful yet was hardly there. I get that the writers were focusing on the original 6 Avengers but there were scenes where it would have been interesting to see her in. Yes, this is the Avengers fight, but it's also Captain Marvels universe that has been affected, so not seeing her as involved as Ant-Man or Nebula was disappointing. Oh and obtaining the Soul stone... Nebula couldn't warn Black Widow and Hawkeye about what was coming? Seriously?? Not something you want to mention beforehand?How did Thanos's ship time travel without a) starks tech and b) the Pym Particle. HELLO THE SHIP WENT SUB ATOMIC INTO THE QUANTAM REALM AND TIME TRAVELLED. What did the 2014 Nebula do to make this happen? And no one noticed a massive ship come shooting out of the time machine and out of the Avengers base?!When Hulk reverses the snap... again we don't know the impact it had on Earth / the Universe. What actually happened? Was everything reset back to 2019, or were the people that turned to dust returned into a new time (5 years later?) and if so why was Peter back in highschool?? And what about the people that were already on Earth, were they also set back to a time right before everyone dissappeared? I guess we see Cassie (Ant-Man) all grown up at the end, but come on... this was a MASSIVE ISSUE and it was not explained in any way whatsoever. I get they wanted the dramatic entrance of the dusted superheroes, but even after the mega action scene at the end there was no explanation of how half the universe came back into life.The movie also never really showed us as an audience the 1 in 14 million ... chain of events that led to the win. Could anyone else have snapped their fingers and dusted away Thanos and his clan? Again... no proper explanation.Tony stark starting the MCU infinity saga and also ended it, perfect... and giving him the appropriate screen time at the end. What about black widow? Couldn't Hawkeye bring her body back? Couldn't someone else travel to where she was and get her body? They just left her there to die alone?For a 3 hour movie you'd expect more of closing story or better explanations, but instead time was wasted on a slow start to the movie. Nonetheless I still enjoyed this movie and it will come to grow on me more and more, but I'm always going to have these questions in the back of my mind every time I watch.Oh... and don't get me started on the time travel MESS."
	
I'm sorry but this movie was boring except for the last part. Infinity war was well balanced and every character had a role. Also had action from beginning to end. But endgame mostly had unnecessary talks or travelling here and there. Most main characters don't even have any fight scenes. Whole movie is focused on only 2-3 characters. Rest of the characters were in it like they just have a cameo. Should have made a semi team up film after infinity war and then Endgame with all the characters having enough screentime. Wasted opportunity.
	
"It's a long film at 3 hours the last one being better because this concludes the 10 year story in at great and satisfying way. The first 2 hours are build up that is ultimately paid off but I felt the middle dragged on I just wanted to get to the end. Infinity war kept me interested the whole time, more than endgame. It's definitely worth the whatch and after you don't have to worry about spoilers.8/10."
	
Anyone of Thor's fans wouldn't accept Marvel's adaptation of Thor. They ruined Thor this character just for making him as the funny elements of the film
	
"Spoiler spoiler spoiler!!!!
I never reviewed a movie in my life but as i just read what the Russo's said about the Hulk and his permanent damaged arm i see that they dont know anything about the character. First no one tackled that he gets stronger when he is angerier second that he has a very high healing factor!
They destroyed him in IW and continued with Endgame. I had high hopes for Endgame based on the ending of IW but i was very disappointed starting from the above and Cap going back to the past and iron man being the center of the universe!"
	
"I'd give this movie a 6/10 at best - it's a mindless action movie trying to be more and people seeing it as more.There's amazing CGI, and when you throw in countless superheros any cliche makes your hair stand up. But for me, this entire film revolved around one-liner comedy in place of character development, and what it's known for best... mindless action.The action doesn't even have to make sense, like Thanos magically 1v5'ing with no infinity stones when in the previous film had issues 1v1'ing with stones. The entire movie is hype revolving around a ridiculous time heist. They even made jokes about how stupid the idea is, and in 30 seconds Iron Man figures it out.This entire movies is cliches, re-used tropes, and one-liners used by familiar actors and amazing CGI. If that's all it takes to be great, good for you!"
	
"The Russo Brothers will be forever known as the directors that failed a franchise and insulted the very fans that embraced it.I have no idea why they felt their finished product would pay homage to Stan Lee's legacy or the characters he brought to life but this closure to a decade of greatness was, in fact, the most disappointing 3-hours of character assassination in cinematic history."
	
I can't describe my disappointment. The movie was very boring with predictable happy end.
	
"Josh Brolin's voice was totally wrong for Thanos. The lips didn't even match the words. I'm also just tired of seeing the SAME old mad man trying to destroy the world and getting defeated by super heroes. Too many characters.At least with the Dark Knight and some of the X-Men films they mixed it up and felt fresh. More superheroes doesn't mean better. Plus the acting was atrocious. The wooden repartee didn't help, done only to make sure everyone gets their lines in.Try a new storyline and/or approach. SKIP IT!"
	
"This movie was a waste of time. I went to see this movie expecting something epic... more epic than Infinity War but was grossly disappointed. Movie was too slow, no action, much drama. I thought this was a comic movie? I wish I could give this movie 0/10."
	
"It's the finale! But they choose to not focus on CGI, EDITING, SOUNDTRACK, CINEMATOGRAPHY, even in storyline! (Time travel, paradox, time here is 5 hours, there is 5 seconds) Same old story! Nothing new, nothing special! They made this movie only to remind us the old MCU movies, it's funny, it's pathetic! Zero new elements, zero imagination! It was 2 hours and 30 minutes pointless and only 30 mins worth! ( Black Widow storyline, Iron Man storyline) About Captain America, they give him poor ending, about Thor, they made him a Joke! About Hulk, they made him powerless! About the other characters, they put them in the movie only to say that they put them! And finally, ZERO PURE SUPERHERO ACTION!!! Only 10-15 minutes, only!! For me, its one of the most overrated movies of all time! Disappointed."
	
"You can't go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending."
	
"It was underwhelming. I guess I had expectations for it, some people hyped it up too much. Infinity was better."
	
"WITHOUT TIME TRAVEL!1. Thanos does not destroy the gauntlet and Thanos does not die immediately at the beginning.2. Redeeming the hate for Captain Marvel: I personally like her character. I enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie. That being said they should have brought her in, had character development with the remaining Avengers team, and got to the task of taking on Thanos and reversing what had happened in Infinity War. It could turn out that her power doesn't exceed but matches Thanos' power. Another possibility is that Thanos who finally has all of the Infinity Stones learns of yet more power that the Gauntlet unleashes. So many possibilities really they never even delved into the Gauntlet and what all it could do.3. That being said they could have tackled it numerous ways without the use of time travel, i will put one scenario out there. With the added power that Captain Marvel brings to the team they could take on Thanos, somehow acquire the Time Stone from the Gauntlet and use that to reverse time. Hell they could even have a huge CGI blowout where time is traveling backwards while they are fighting the mighty Thanos. Time reverses until they get back to the point where Infinity War left off. With all Marvel characters present they could have the biggest battle scene a Marvel movie has had to date. One where they tie up the contract issues with the actors and the ones that have to die could have died during the battle. So many variations they could have gone with and made it a much more edge-of-your-seat ride than what they put out, which was mostly boring, filled with plots holes and left me underwhelmed to say the least. I have no plans to re-watch Endgame in the near future, if at all.In conclusion i just wrote this in five minutes on a lazy Sunday afternoon after a week of brooding about how bad Endgame was. Marvel had an entire team of hundreds, probably thousands of people to put out a better product than what we got. It was a cop out film and everyone involved should be embarassed that that was the final product after so many years of building this exciting franchise."
	
It s the first time i bother to write a review about a movie....but i m so disappointed that i have to say some things....i saw the movie having the highest expectations as a marvel fan and after the infinity war which was a masterpiece.....this movie was a DISASTER...i really felt bored...no action...silly jokes and favorite characters that in all previous marvel movies were strong and fighters now they were like random guest stars...i don t understand why the plot had to ruin thor hulk and thanos...i left the cinema with my friends and we were all disappointed....i really don t understand how everybody says this is a PERFECTION.....marvel has given us really great movies....unfortunately that was not one of them...
	
How can people give this film anymore than one star! Infinity war was amazing and set up such a good story then this guff appeared in our screens! Sickening political correctness moments! What was the point of hyping captain marvel for her to be in this for 5 minutes! Ruined the hulk character! Best character by far was happy who had the best scene in the movie!
	
"I think Marvel films are fine, I understand loving them I really do. Spider-Man 2 is my personal favourite, but please stop giving these movies a 10/10. Endgame is a 7 at best. It's probably the most flawed Avengers film story wise. It's popcorn fun, but it's like if we let Fast & Furious or Transformers films in the top 250. Meanwhile 2001: A Space Oddisey is lower than Infinity War."
	
"Not sure if it's a good idea to write a review here, as it seems, that Fanboys are rating down carefully considered reviews, just because they are not praising endgame, but so be it.I was not really disappointed, but I was also not stunned by this movie. It had a lot of shortcomings, logic-flaws and humor that simply wasn't funny or jokes that were somehow not fitting into the storyline. Some characters developed in a direction, I personally did not like and the overall ending to the movie seemed rushed and somehow chaotic.Overall it was a decent ending to this MCU phase, but as always, it's down to personal preference if you like a movie or not or if you wished for a different storyline.There are too many things, that were illogical:
Nebula not telling the guys what it takes to get the soul stoneTony Stark not even questioning why Pepper is in the end-fight and not taking care of their childrenDepressed, fat ThorCaptain America being able to use Thor's hammerCaptain America living a life with his girlfriend without someone remembering it in their timelineAll of a sudden, all dead heros appear out of nowhere - all coming from Wakanda - how the heck did they know and gather in the first place?If you haven't seen Captain Marvels end credit-scene, Captain Marvel would appear right out of nowhere in this movie and everyone would wonder why.Thor being depressed and fat and this Softie-Version of Hulk were the main character developments I also did not like.Personally didn't like Tony Stark being killed, but one saw that coming. After all, his story was told. Captain America living another live at least got him a happy end, although and illogical one. The hairstyle of captain Marvel ... ok, let's not talk about this one.There are certain scenes that are indeed epic, overall, the movie was entertaining, but I honestly liked Infinity War more.Cannot tie this to specfic reasons, it's a combination of all the aforementioned elements, that simply didn't do the trick for me to make it an epic movie.Considering myself being a big fan of the MCU franchise, I think all fans should see it, but if you are at least somehow interested in a decent and logic storyline, be warned you might not be too overwhelmed by this movie."
	
"Are you moviegoer? Waited to long for conclusion? You'll be disappointed.
No heart in movie. No character depth and worst of all there are incidents whether they cared about story at all.
Verify yourself..
1. All the avengers are shown cry babies. Looks like they are fighting without purpose. How are they going to defend their motive - that we support hunger and poverty! They bring war again to the earth and snapped Thanos' army. Then what does changed - that Thanos killed more and we killed less!
At least Thanos had genuine intent.
They should have have cared more about story.
2. All the movie they discussed philosophy, paradox and science of time travel and yet failed to deliver on that front.
i. Future Nebula kills her own past still she exists in present.
ii. Captain himself altered the time line. Are there no consequences?
iii. They kill Thanos' past. How come future is still same.
The reason thrown in movie is that they are playing with their own time line. Does our life and time lines work this independently.
3 Most worse (I know, I'm using 2 superlatives in single sentence.)
In whole movie, in all fight scenes all you witness is death of bad guys and conveniently not a single good guy die there.
villain bombs the building whole structure collapses and yet surprisingly no one dies.Ok.. There are more you'll find them yourself if you watch the movie.If want some respite then Gamora is not shown in last scene and you can cry out where is Gamora.P. S. On single watch i reached to this conclusion that this is the worst, out of reference movie of Marvel universe. If you think otherwise please share."
	
"2,5 hours of nonsense and gigantic plotholes. 15 minutes of action which is a total mess. CGI looks good, bit dark. Thor, one of the strongest badass characters in Marvel Universe is a drunk fat dude, does not make sense. Cap. America who can use Thors Hammer suddenly with lightning abilities, why? Cap. Marvel is OP, shows up randomly does huge amounts of damage and dissapears again list goes on and on... Iron man is the only character in this movie who deservers credits in my opinion. Infinity war is way better, its really overrated."
	
"Overrated, 2 boring hours and 1 hour fighting. A movie that depends on the effects only"
	
"What a waste of time! Let's start by: Why the hell did they put Thor dumb, fat, drunk, a loser, and as the laughing stock?? And why on earth was the Hulk smaller, thinner, weaker and stupid?? Why was Thanos stronger without the infinity stones?? And can someone tell me why Captain Marvel was so useless - it was pointless having her in this film; I have no idea why they worked so hard in adding her character into the film, when she clearly did absolutely nothing! Captain Marvel failed along with the whole other 150 woman failed. Girl power at its best. Captain Marvel was powerless, pointless and ridiculed in front of the world watching this stupid film. I'm sorry, 20 Avengers and none of them couldn't do anything??? And why did Tony had to die out of all the other characters?? Seriously, couldn't Falcon, Dr. Strange or Mantis die instead - they were good for nothing. And how did Falcon get to be Captain America? What about Bucky-- War Machine-- heck even Rocket would have been better. A good 45 minutes of poor blah blah that could have been used for action fight scenes. Disappointments everywhere."
	
"In my opinion, they should have never filmed Endgame, it would be much better to finish everything with Infinity War, it would be much better because Infinity War was THE BEST EVER. and Endgame was very, very weak movie compared to it or any other marcel movie. I would prefer to not have seen Endgame."
	
"I show this movie two time store is good but the end is very very bad
This's the badest end from all marvel"
	
"Infinity War is a Masterpiece and there is no comparison between IW and Endgame more like EndLame.
This movie is full of plotholes , poorly written dramatic scenes and not so funny funny scenes.
Why does Ironman has to die , why he had to wear the gauntlet to snap Thanos when they were going to beat Thanos anyway. Fat thor, useless Hulk, ant-man , captain marvel, hawkeye, captain America , black panther, doctor strange, spiderman , Ironman etc all were there. There was no need of that end snap. I know they wanted to give Iron man a farewell but in a satisfying way, in movie it felt like it was totally useless. And what about Hulk and thanos encounter , oh yeah there wasn't one. I was waiting for proffessor Hulk to step up to Thanos , another disappointment.
Many people liked the last interaction between Hawkeye and Black widow but personally found it cringy and over dramatic with lame writing.
In IW you can clearly see every character was given their share of screen time and justified roles but Endgame was mess .
I have watched IW in theatres 4 times plus many times at home and i would still watch it and enjoy but Endgame i can't.
Many stupid fanboys and casual watchers might find this movie good but the people who likes things making sense and a story which takes you deep into it would feel how unsatisfying this movie is .
Even casting Brie Larson as captian marvel wasn't that bad as this movie .Last words : Infinity War wasn't the movie we deserved but It was the movie we needed.
And this movie (Endgame) is not even close to what it should be."
	
"Well, was hyped to the max for this movie but in the end, Avengers Endgame was as bad as its name and was the worst Avengers movie. Story was disconnected and dialogues were cliche. Thanos and Avengers doing hand to hand combat was beyond ridiculous.Utmost focus on Cap and Iron Man. Unimaginable nerfing of Thanos, Thor and Hulk. Time travel was handled extremely badly. Humor was overused and movie felt like Gotg-3. Power of Avengers and Thanos was not visualized properly and battle/fight scenes felt bland. I need to re-watch Infinity War to forget this abomination."
	
"1.Captain America is the new king of Asgard, god of lightning
2. No fight scene with hulk
3.Time travel is a mess
4. I have other 1000 questions"
	
Probably one of the worst Avengers movie to date. The plot was extremely childish and did not make sense. Completely went astray from the plot described in the comics. Very disappointed...
	
"Couldn't believe how long this film was when I heard! 3 hours is just overwhelmingly bad if you ask me but still considering that I seen the previous 3 films I had to give this one a chance at least once.Went into this knowing the torture of watching a 3 hour film with an over stretched story line, plot holes galore, dragged scenes & political correctness shoved down your throat & that wasn't even the icing on the cake!But then after watching I found the film was below 3 hours. Actually, it was 2 hours & 49 minutes in total, but that's no far off the 3 hour mark. The film itself was ok & I mean below mediocre at best & at worst overrated!The story-line was easy enough to follow, but still had some confusing points which weren't well executed. Like the part where they traveled back in time & they were fighting their past selves. Other plot points too which didn't illustrate well what was happening or what was what.The run time which is obviously the biggest let down also contributed to the dragging nature which stretched out a story-line so simple it could've snapped! The ending especially was like watching paint dry in slow motion & my arse felt pretty numb when I left the cinema.There was some good action parts but there isn't much goes to say about this film or others like it which are clearly forgettable & loaded with confusing story-lines, details & sci-fi overkill.I also didn't appreciate the political correctness & female feminazi empowerment in this film which I seen twice at the finale part. A black woman at the end being king or leader of the land instead of Thor really? I don't know... I'd say that political correctness itself is just part of the issue I have with these films overall. It needs to stop!Overall not good & seriously over hyped for what it is! I can safely say these films have gone down hill since the beginning of the 2010's. They've delved into too much sci-fi, complicated story-lines with too much details, are too up in the air & not grounded enough & are riddled with political correctness! It's just sad as the classics before it were so much better & watchable, if not RE-watchable!The 10/10 reviews are clearly fake & once again proves just how biased the rating system has become with paid reviewers giving this junk anything over what I've rated it as. More honesty & less BS.2/10"
	
"Not worth it..... three hours from my life .....
Boring, long, it should be better."
	
"This movie is everything I ever wanted, and even more!Beginning of this movie was shocking and brave, killing of that evil purple guy Thanos at the very beginning. Very cool...Making Thor fat and depressed, without any development throughout the movie, and watching all people in the audience laughing at him made me really sad, being fat, worthless and depressing slog of a man myself, people made fun of me too! Finally, I had someone to identify myself to. FINALLY!!!Time travel part of plot was, should I say, very cool, and reminded me of many other great movies with time travel. I didn't expected them to go in that direction! That part made the plot of this movie very complex, I didn't get the part with captain america at the end, but I clapped and cried with the rest of the ladies in theater because it was a perfect ending for that sweet man, leaving his friends and world's needs to finally get laid.Iron man and Natasha dying was a bold choice, i cried and clapped in those moments. Oh, I clapped when Cap lift Thors hammer too, and learned how to use it immediately, oh what a perfect fan service.This movie was little slow, sometimes little boring, but boy oh boy did it pulled off in that insane third act! That was so FUN! I mean movies should always be fun, right? Not to mention that IMPORTANT girl power moment, with every super girl superhero in one shot, a real cheer leading moment!In short, PERFECTION!"
	
This movie is so long and boring don't understand where the hype is! Not any close to infinity war! Senseless! Please save your 3hrs! Trust me
	
The best part of this episode was that Thor has put a few extra pounds on him. And that pretty much says it all.
	
"Other reviews have added what a hot mess this is. I have a theory that resorting to use time-travel as a fix-all is nothing more than a lazy way out. It proved so here for sure. The holes in the time-travel portion of the plot are big enough to drive a Mack Truck thru.And it gets worse the more you ponder it. Hulk as wimp? Thor as a fat couch potato? And Captain Marvel... She's hinted to be the savior all during the credits of Infinity War then makes little more than a cameo appearance in End Game.The movie did succeed as a way to get Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr. out of the MCU going forward. Bravo, we didn't need 3 hours for that.After waiting 15 minutes for a post-credit scene and getting nada, I felt that kinda summed up the whole movie."
	
"First, let me preface by saying I've only seen one other movie in MCU and that was Ant-Man. A friend had an extra ticket and did not want to go alone. I completely understand that there were plenty other movies that lead up to this one, but I still saw Endgame and this is the take of someone not heavily invested in MCU.The movie by itself and very cliché and boring, and I will say that without having seen the other films there is no character development to allow you build any emotional connection with any of the characters.The movie was off to a decent start with some mild humor and storyline, but nearing the last hour I lost all interest. The movie just gave into an overly long and cliché fight scene showing you how many different characters from other movies they could shove in. From there it just played out exactly as one would expect. There were a couple deaths here and there, but those characters were lost with no emotional attachment built during the film. My takeaway was relief when the credits finally rolled.If you like predictable, action movies then this is probably the movie for you. If you are not familiar with the MCU franchise, this is definitely not the place to familiarize. If you are looking for a movie with substance and takeaway, then this is also not the movie for you."
	
"Please give me back the 3 hours spent in the theater to see this.All plot is overall stupid, it's like sooooooo long... and stretched..To much hype for.. nothing actually."
	
"Dont miss understand my title, I'm a huge fan of the Avengers, even more I have watched the 20 movies for the past month in anticipation for the ENDGAME.. However after watching it I'm really disappointed 😥 for the below:
1- First half an hour was really disappointing. I mean after making a full movie on Thanos, the avengers killed him that easily !!!! Come on .. the writers shouldn't expect us to be this fool?
2- Thor being fat and not funny ?? Comeon he fought battles and lost all of his family and friends & Asgard & he was still standing ?? So what changed that he became that desperate?? Totally un believeable and weird.
3- Time Travel ??? Are we in the 90s or 80s !!! Comeon it's so lame and unbelievable.. otherwise Stark should have thought about it straight after thanos happened, & not wait for an ANT stupid as a rock to tell him.
4- Killing the black widow is not believable ?? Since when they love each other that much ??? Doesnt this arrow man has wife and kids & black widow love Hulk !!
5- We all new that iron man was going to be killed , so no surprise in that??
6- No action whatsoever, as the only 20 minutes came from the ending were everyone was already starting to sleep, & it was not so good.Overall, long wait to end up with bullocks, very disappointing writing , & 3 hours of wasting time .... Wish they had put more thought in it , and give the fans an enjoyable movie, instead of this waste of time."
	
"I don't even know where to begin writting this review. There's so much bullshit in this movie, it's unbelievable.So, first things first. Hulk and Thor...
Starting with Hulk: One of the strongest avengers reduced to a joke. The whole merge of Hulk and Banner was one of the most boring things I've ever seen, and it did nothing for the movie plot.Thor...now this one really was the WORST. They did him so dirty! We go from Ragnarok and Infinity War Thor, a more mature character who was powerful enough to almost defeat Thanos when he had the infinity stones to drunk Santa Claus, that can't even defeat Thanos without the infinity stones even though he had both Mjölnir and Stormbreaker....that was a huge plot whole. His character was reduced to a joke for comedic purposes BUT IT WASN'T EVEN FUNNY.And Cap, Well i havo no problem with his character at all but him being able to use Mjölnir and produce lightening? Nah...way too forced. Cap shouldn't be able to control Thunder.Also, plot wholes were just stupid... Them going back in time is already bad enough, but there were so many plot wholes... Why didn't Nebula die when she killed her past self? Where was Vision and how did they get his stone? Why wasn't Loki there if they went back in time? People keep saying it was because Thanos killed him before the stones but they went back in time before Ragnarok, soThanos never got to Thor's ship!
How come Banner struggled so much snapping his fingers but Tony just did it right away?The scene where Natasha died was also mehh, it should have been her and Banner (not the merge, just Banner) we would get closure from those two, and a it would have been way more emotional than what it was. If they kept Banner's struggle to make Hulk ''appear'' that would have been a good way to make Hulk finally come back angrier than ever and fight like he's supposed to..
And finally the epic final battle was totally forgeatable... it lacked power, lacked that emotion thor gave us in infinity war when he got stormbreaker. Lacked powerful soundtracks to go with the flow of the scenes....lacked a lot of things."
	
"This movie was the biggest let down and anti climax of all time, I am one of the true marvel fans having grown up with the comics and watching all the big and small screen adaptations however this movie had the hype and potential to be the biggest greatest movie of all time , it wasn't it was rubbish !! And a joke , I felt so strongly about this i created this account just to write a review on this horrible movie . I won't spoil it but it was a rip off and a cheat infinity war was amazing 10/10 but endgame is 1/10 also just to rub salt into the wound there is no end credit cut scene so don't waste your time.... you are welcome,I can't believe the money this movie will make and it isn't even any good"
	
"The reason I rated this movie at 1/10 is that it is the finale to the 22 Marvel movies and the sequel to the greatest of them, Infinity War. Maybe if I have watched it as a standalone superhero movie I would have given it 5 or 6/10.First, time travel? Seriously? We waited all this time for this. I didn't know want to know anything about the movie and had really high expectations, but had I known they elected to choose time travel as the solution for getting everyone back I wouldn't have rushed to the movies to watch it. It is as lame as the time travel movies that were mocked in endgame and such movies can only have a specific fanbase. You can't just throw in a bunch of quantum physics and I don't know what and suddenly it all becomes possible. Nebula fighting with another Nebula, captain America fighting with captain America from another time? Seriously I can't believe the team behind it was that desperate to come up with these freaking ideas.Second and more importantly, where is the action in this movie? Almost 15 minutes out of the 3 hours where all avengers fight randomly against all villains. No fun whatsoever. Was this supposed to be a movie for everyone to enjoy, or a tribute to the MCU universe? Almost 3 hours of drama and jokes that are out of context. If I wanted to watch a comedy or drama I would have gone elsewhere. When I go watch a superhero movie, I expect a lot of action and CGI, remember infinity war, and this movie has nothing to offer.Now I must comment on the high ratings that this movie receives. I believe most people will have rated the movie high regardless of whether good or bad, just because it is the last avengers movie and sequel to infinity war. Truth is the movie is really bad. But I wouldn't recommend anyone not to watch it, after all everyone wants to know how it ends, which is also why the movie is breaking box office records, just don't have high expectations, because this is the most dull, unsatisfying finale the MCU can offer."
	
This movie proves the Russo brothers are in a league of their own when it comes to closing a franchise this big. In my opinion they pulled of the most satisfying ending this story arc could have.It's nothing without its previous 21 movies. Must watch for every movie fan.
	
"If you're a big Hulk fan don't waste your time or money!3 hour movie and not any Hulk smash action?!?! Really! Extremely disappointing! I didn't expect Hulk to take the lead but come on, really! They misrepresented professor Hulk. When the Hulk found out Nat died he should've went into worldbreaker Hulk and put Thanos in the ground. Most of the other avengers had their shot at Thanos. Huge battle at the end and, you guessed it, no Hulk action. Not even 5 minutes of the big guy getting angry. They put the Hulk on the sidelines for the last 2 avengers and emasculated him. Horrible! The worst Avenger movie. Oh yeah, fat Thor and gay support group Cap, bad move. They took the 2 most powerful Avengers Hulk and Thor pussified and neutered them. Gross!Because of this movie I will not watch another marvel movie!"
	
"This movie is so full of cliches, it is so unoriginal and filled with stale humour that you just shouldn't do something as bad as watching this to yourself."
	
"Thor is represented like a 5 year old girl. I'll explain it below. There are so many plot holes, unnecessary extended dialogue scenes but no action to satisfy except for 8-10 minutes in the second part. It really is boring.You see, there are epic scenes in movie series, especially in the finale of so called movie series which people -even after years- turn back and watch on internet and have fun and get pleasure from it. There are none in this garbage.
For example;
In HP:
Dumbledore vs VoldemortBattle of HogwartsDumbledore's fire spell in the 6th movieThe scene in which Voldemort was destroying the protection spell of HogwartsIn LOTR:
Gandalf vs BalrogThe whole battle of Helm's Deep, plus RohirrimRohirrim's arrival in ROKThe scene in which the eagles and Gandalf saved Frodo and Sam... I can give countless example.But there are none in this finale. In this garbage, all we have is utter disappointment, stupid jokes, no action.Here comes the spoiler:
Spoiler
Ok, I know that mjolnir was lifted in the comics by some other characters as well but this is NOT an excuse for Thor, being so useless and unable to use Mjolnir with his might whereas Captain America beats Thanos with the combos that even Thor couldn't perform. In Infinity War, Thor slashed Thanos even though Thanos had the gauntlet. But in this movie, Thor fights like a 5 year old. He could do nothing against Thanos even though Thanos wasn't wearing the gauntlet and Thor was using both mjolnir and stormbreaker. Captain America saved Thor from being killed by Thanos by using mjolnir. Stupidity doesn't end here guys. Captain America hit Thanos with lightining and threw Thanos and smashed him to the ground by using lightining with the help of mjolnir. They showed Thor like a garbage can, a comic relief. Where is the power of Thor? We know, we get it; Thor is in depression but just because he is in depression, it doesn't mean that he lost his powers. It's all american propaganda; giving all the powers and might to Captain America and destroying other characters. It's all contradictions. So Thor can't be able to use his godly powers but Captain America uses those powers? Ffs, wtf? Sorry but it's not possible for Thor to be weaker than Cap. America. I can't believe that Captain America was turned into Thor. Where is the power of Thor that we saw in Thor (2011), where is the power of Thor that we saw in Ragnarok, where is the power of Thor that we saw in Infinity War. Do you expect us to believe that Thor lost his godly powers in 5 years and he can't summon a storm, lightining but a Captain America can?
Don't forget that same Odin who said whoever is worthy, shall possess the power of Thor also said Are you God of Hammers? That hammer was to help you control your power, to focus it, was never the source of your strength. There should have been balance. Marvel overlooked so many things. They could have done the same here. They could have reflect Captain in a more respectable way to audience without destroying Thor and undermining his background. I don't care about how much you children downvote. It's an utter disrespect for the funs. Garbage is garbage. As an Mcu fan, I feel sad for what they did.Instead of Iron man and Natasha, there were other characters who should have died.A piece of garbage."
	
"The film was ok, but i don't see Marvel in it.
I see frustrations, unanswered questions, heroes unavailable and heroes unused.
I enjoyed it, but i went in with too many expectations.
And in the end i can only say: Plot holes ftw"
	
"Don't waste your time, it's incredibly bad, 3 hours you will never get back."
	
"It was suppose to be the most anticipating movie for any marvel fans after waiting for over a decade, but alas the story line was just repeating itself, rather lets just call it Avengers: Endgame repeated stories from the past films!
time travel was another huge disappointment! shows real lazy writing, screen cast etc! there are more than 14 million ways the screenwriter and director could have made it different!
a few punch lines and the end fight was only worth the money spent for watching it!
as a whole i would just say sorry marvel you just lost it ! please don't bring back anymore of your films!
you just lost a huge fan after watching this crap!
sayonara Marvel, and i hope nobody watches your upcoming stupid spider-boy with a dumb brain!"
	
"I swear this movie is the worst thing i've ever seen of my life. Marvel, it's over for me"
	
"The storyline being absolutely terrible is almost unrepairable. However, they do try and fail. The bjg problem is it's finally clear the choppiness and flow are off due secrecy and too much outsourcing. In order to obacure the plot, different companies are awarded different CGI scenes without ever being told the whole enchilada so that they can't leak anything... Of course this method requires there to be a very strong movie plot to begin with or you end up with chop suey. This movie has a few moments of good laughs and one liners... And that's it. It's a total and complete failure."
	
"Unbelievable and forced moments littered throughout. From a rat that magically lets ant-man out who happens to put the whole story in motion to Thor being turned into a weak and badly CgI'd overweight character to Captain America yielding Thor's hammer and his only reaction being I knew it, a cringeworthy girl power scene and cheesy one liners.... I started checking my watch an hour in. Terribly disappointing, it felt more like DC than Marvel. I don't understand how people thought this was good!"
	
"Marvel fan for years now and I am disappointed about Endgame.Avengers 2 is much better, full of action with multiple scenes, full cover for each single hero"
	
"What the hell did you do, a comedy serosuly.
so Thor could have nearly killed thanos in the first move with the infinity gauntlet, but in the second move with 2 hammers they couldn't land a fatel blow really guys!!!
pym particals seriously this is the direction you chose, from all materials you have you chose pym particals.
then we have the hulk that has been totally destroyed don't get me started on Thor"
	
I slept during movie first time in my entire life.I can bare any kind of movie in my life but this was litery garbage movie. My humble request is to stay at home give time to ur family dont waste money on this movie.
	
"This is my first time to review a movie ! , who end the marvel universe like this ?
they should have gone for infinity war as an end for the 11 years !
I mean the movie was too much rush ! first of all they made infinity gauntlet like it's some kids toys even though earlier in the movies they said it's super hard to done.
time travel thing ? was pushed into the movie in complicated fast way .
and they disrespected thor ! one of the toughest avengers ! and had a center role in infinity war , they made him fat and drunky guy which no one listened to and take him for serious !
and hulk ? they destroyed him too in the movie !
and since when a human being can carry or hold an infinty stone !
sooo much gaps and plot holes !
i watched all marvel films and infinity war was amazing ! i thought it was the prequel to the final epic ending ! after seeing endgame , my opinion ? they should've stopped at infinity war ! it would been have the greatest ending !"
	
Very bad movie just waste of time and money. in the first two hours of the movie nothing happen.
	
Feeling cheated after watching the movie at high rate ticket. nothing new same action. worst movie of avengers series.
	
"3 hours long with 30 minutes of action, and all that action coming at the end so it's basically a 2 hr long drama with a pathetic final battle.This movie could of been 1 hr 30 max but they decide to drag on all the conversations that are all pointless anyway, Hawkeye gets more screen time then basically anyone and who cares anyway.They destroyed hulk and made him and Thor a complete joke, overpowered captain America and this movie should of just been called iron man 4Hulk dabbing and Thor playing fornite just came across as try hard and I can't believe how boring an avengers movie could be.Such hype for such a let down, anyone who reviews this movie as a 10 has absolutely no idea, how can this movie be a 10 it absolutely bores you for 2 hours then throws in some trash 30 mins at the end which is mostly Hawkeye and captain America fighting anyway which are 2 of the weakest characters and Thanos beats everyone so easily with no stones while hulk almost drowns from nothing lolThis movie was an absolute joke I hope Russo brothers don't make another marvel movie because this was an absolute boring peice of crap and they are destroying hulk and Thor"
	
"The first two hours seem like an attempt at drama plus almost no new scenes but rather a rehash of the previous 3 movies.The plot is essentially the same as the previous movie, Thanos wants stones, Avengers fight Thanos. The only new thing here is that instead of losing the Avengers win.I honestly felt like I was ripped off since I had to pay to see the same plot as previously plus a summary of previous movies...Incredible that no one seems to notice this, and completely mind-blowing that this movie will outsell Avatar which is an original amazing movie.The plot is so full of holes and makes absolutely zero sense as well."
	
"Let me start I'm a big fan of marvel so there is no biased against them.
This movie is a big pile of trash. Don't give them your hard earn cash like I did, wish I could take back 3 hours of my life.
Director thinks we watch superheroes movies looking for oscar winning performances.
2hours of nonsense time travel talk, about 15min action and than more nonsense pushing agenda #metoomovement?. I thought about walking out several times.Rubbish."
	
"Most annoying avenger movie, thor totally over shadowed, no charm n charizma of thor in a single scene....captain n iron man finished... captain would never choose his own self over the world ... you guys just had to finish his character so you took this irritating story line where catain stayed with peggy.. no goose bumps throughout the whole movie"
	
The strory was going nowhere and killing the thanos we loved and replacing him with one we didnt care about was a bad move
	
"First things first - I would call myself a moderate Marvel fan. I have watched most of the movies and know enough about the plot and general lore to be able to watch the movies without going who the hell is this every minute.Having said that I think that the movie was average. Not bad. Not good. Just a film you watch and then forget about two days later. When I watched Infinity War in cinema I was pretty impressed - I wasn't dying over it, but for a superhero movie it introduced a lot of new ideas to the table.Endgame on the other hand just feels like a chinese takeover from two days ago you stumble upon in your fridge. Most of the plot is just boring. There is little to no tension, the action jumps all over the place, the actions of the heroes often make no sense at all. I am not a fan of time travel because it takes a lot of skill and precision to write a story that isn't chaotic. And Endgame didn't manage to convey a good time travel story - which is like what the whole movie is about basically.All in all I think Endgame might have been released a bit to early. They should have put some more time, thought and effort into it, especially when this movie was supposed to be the grand, spectacular finale of such a huge scale saga. A bit dissapointing."
	
"I don't have to give away any spoilers to say this movie was terrible. I was so excited to see this movie. First, I have watched every superhero movie that lead to the creation of this movie. Please don't believe the critic reviews or other obviously paid for reviews. This movie was horribly boring, with very limited action. I enjoy comicbook and fantasy movies, but I also enjoy a good drama. The issue isn't that I couldn't appreciate the emotional aspect of the movie, it's simply that it was done very poorly. There were so many issues with the plot, and characters, but worst of all is a tremendous amount of pointless, long sections of uninteresting dialog. On top of this, the very few action scenes that were in the movie were really poorly done. For the most part, they were a blurry, choppy mess, and you couldn't appreciate what was happening enough to make it effective and cool. If you like movies that are boring, and try to play on your heart strings in a really contrived way, instead of being entertaining, then this is the perfect movie for you."
	
Firstly. I would like to clarify myself that I am a huge fan of marvel and never miss any movies right from the start. IW is a gem and rewatched over 10 times. All actors and actresses in these movies are simply the best in the world.BUT hey! This endgame is a joke! There is no way that I can fully focus on the movie due to the ridiculous plot holes. Time travel? Stones to return but no impact to the world that people from the past died? There's too many questions in my brain now. The more you think the worse it gets.Come on Marvel fans. You are ok to accept the epic era ends with a fat and lazy Thor and a nerd Hulk who can't fight? Not me.
	
"3 hours about nothing.
Only one reason why this movie has too large box office is hyping."
	
"I'm a huge marvel fan, and my biggest issue with this movie was how they treated Captain America. In the end he goes back in time to live his life with Peggy. Some saw this as romantic, the ending he deserved.I saw it as throwing away the years of growth we've seen this character go through to move on and be happy in the future. The film makers got scared and played the easy way out -- by sending him back in time. Not even touching down upon the time travel issues by having him live out his time along with a second Steve, did they really have Steve Rogers completely abandon his best friends for a girl he liked for two weeks?The ending of his character shocked and disappointed me. My review will probably be taken down, but hey. Maybe someone will see this."
	
Really? Time travel is how you save the world and bring back half of it?
	
"THE WORST !!!
they turned what should have been the best comic book plot, into a bollywood melodrama, it's just pathetic.
don't waste your time watching babies material."
	
"Don't trust the highest scores, trust the bad review. It's waste three hours film and bad storyline (not make any sense and confused). I don't understand why people likes it, I didn't cry or laugh but felt sleepy.Here are the few things that I don't like the movie
1. Too many superheroes against baby Thanos.
2. Timeline - That is cheating and all the superheroes stills lose.
3. It's not an action film, it more likes drama/sci-fi film.
4. Natasha (black widow) didn't have to die, she should uses Red skull.
5. Thor and Hulk are lazy and they are no need to be in the film and possibly the other superheroes.
6. What is Rocket doing? Why did he need to travel in time?
7. Ironman didn't have to put the glove on but use the remote control to snap the finger.I can't think of what else to write here but if you want to watch this, it's better to wait for rental dvd/digital to save your money."
	
Not sure about the rave reviews. But was a huge let down. It felt as if they just wanted to end the series . Infinity war could have been a better ending. Lot of flaws on time travel theory as well.
	
"I don't understand the hype behind this movie or most of the Marvel movies. I went into this movie open minded after hearing everyone tell me how great it was and after the first hour and a half I was bored. It's almost as if Marvel has started to make comedy movies rather than super hero action movies. Now I am fine with having some comic relief but holy hell. For starters, they completely ruined the Hulk and Thor who are two of the most powerful and captivating characters. I don't understand why they just decided to have the Hulk become a big joke of a character but they did. I thought his main thing was that he was angry all the time which made him way more interesting than a science nerd but ok I guess so. Then they decide to make Thor just a slob that drinks beer and plays fortnite. I saw Korg holding the controller and thought to myself if they are playing fortnite this movie is embarrassing and believe it or not they were. I could not believe it when I saw what they did to Thor. The God of Thunder and King of Asgard has a mid life crisis after losing to Thanos when he has 1000 years of being a battle tested warrior and is now an overweight bum and is that for the ENTIRE MOVIE.
The other thing in this movie that made me mad was that they tried to force all of these character relationships onto the viewer. I do not care about Hawkeye and Black Widows weird romance/friendship because as far as I can see, they are both kinda useless in the grand scheme of things. Honestly they both probably should have died in the first avengers but we will blame plot armor for that one. I also do not care about captain America and Peggy's relationship or Tony Starks new family that is a thing when the movie just jumps ahead in tome 5 years. This is probably because I think Pepper is one of the most annoying movie character of all time.
The last thing I will rant about is the fighting. For a 3 hour movie you would expect to see some cool fight scenes but no. We got a bunch of fast moving shots and a lot of different characters running with the gauntlet. To make matters worse, Thanos was just so not intimidating in the slightest. It's almost as if he stood 0 chance and everyone knew it. Overall this movie was 3 hours of superheroes sitting around telling some dumb jokes that people think are hilarious for some reason and then winning the battle with little trouble.
Other problem with the movie:
1. Bucky should have gotten Captains shield
2. Time travel? Really. Stark figures out time travel in 30 minutes after 5 years of sitting around and it works without any problem besides when captain America fought his past self and somehow nobody in the building saw it.
3. Thor joining the guardians is cool but also WTF
4. Captain Marvel should have just stayed with the avengers and try to fix the problem rather than run off to other planets and come back at very convenient times. Total cop out
5. The hulk should have fought thanos. Total blown opportunity"
	
Went into movie theater expecting an epic finale and a much better movie than infinity war; alas it was so anti climatic so boring so full of plot holes an elephant would've passed through them - or a hulk for that matter - very disappointing movie overall!!!
	
"I can only conclude that Disney are using bots to post 10 star ratings for this film.
Infinity War is better in every conceivable way.
I have to confess that after infinity war I had no idea how they could possibly top that.... it was going to take some great writing to turn the events of IW and create a movie that was better again.......I didn't happen.
I can't emphasize how bad I thought the story was.
It feels like a desperate attempt to conclude this saga early so they can start on the next wave.
1. You can't introduce a character as powerful as captain marvel into a fist fight.
2. Never ever ever use time travel in any movie... unless it's a comedy like bttf or hot tub.
3. Don't create scenes that make no sense just to appease the woman's movement in Hollywood...cheapInfinity war deserved so much more than this.Do yourself a favour and finish your saga with infinity war and forget this mess of a movie ever existed."
	
I feel like wasted my time and money on infinity as everything was reversed through time machine. So you never know if endgame will also be reversed in next film through time machine. Further first 2 hours are soooooo boring that you can skip and join for last one hour to watch action vfx.
	
"Has a lot of plotholes, but I still enjoyed it. However, the rating should be lowered to atleast 7 so im giving it 1 to balance it out, as all things should be."
	
I can't believe this movie has as high a rating as it does. This movie was so slow! It was more a drama then an action movie. You just had sad characters crying for the first two hours.And don't get me started on the time travel paradoxes. Time travel stories are for simpletons that can't write anything good.
	
"Seriously don't believe the 9.1 score and give the movie any more money.
Movie was a horrible mess.
Aweful attempt at oscar performance. 2hours of talking about nothing. Hardly any action.
Time travel nonsense."
	
"An all you can eat experience, but as most all you can eat restaurants the food quality is not the best. Shallow plot with many loopholes. Total waste of time."
	
"Seemed like 20 minutes of action at the most out of 3 hours. The film didnt need to be that long. The scenes that were meant to be emotional were executed poorly, didnt make me feel anything other than boredom. Seems all the 10 star ratings are just from marvel fans! Face it guys, it is a bad film. The previous avengers was 1000x better. The whole length of infinity war was about them defeating thanos, in this film it took them 20 minutes."
	
"This movie drug on far too long. Captain Marvel ruined every scene she was in. Stars given for Thors performance which was hilarious. Looking forward to Ragnorak 2, maybe."
	
"Highlights of why it's terrible.Infinity stones control the flow of the universe and cannot be removed (sorceress supreme - endgame), I destroyed the stones (Thanos - endgame).Killing yourself while someone tries to stop you is not the other person making a sacrifice (soul stone would not be acquired)A sword cannot cut vibranium, jesus thors hammer doesn't scratch the ain't (Thanos America)Scarlet witch can easily kill Thanos so why doesn't she finish the job.The power of the gauntlet is the user can harness the power of the stones without being affected by them. (iron man and hulk would be unharmed, Thanos was only injured because he was trying to destroy them, he explains this at the start)An android linked to a cloud would know that she is and would switch off her WiFi.Someone who would contaminate 50 years of history because he misses his girlfriend is a personality trait that would prevent them being able to wield thors hammer.There are hundreds of inconsistencies compared to the established universe, if you are giving this film a ten star rating take off your rose tinted glasses."
	
"They robbed us with the last move, for goodbye!
It is all about the money!"
	
This movie is so boring.Too many unnecessary details.You have to sit in movie for 3 hours so i dont think its worth it.I waa dissapointed and really sad after watching it.Dont waste your money and this movie doesnt deserve anithing accept 1.
	
"No Spoilers
This movie epitomises why I no longer pay to go to the cinema. It must be a free ticket and I must be bored. Those are my two criteria. It is therefore quite ironic that this film is boring. Was I not clear in my criteria. I said I must be bored. NOT I want to see a BORING film! I quite enjoyed Infinity Wars to some extent but this film was just plain stupid. It must have been written by the children of the directors. It's that bad. I tried to tolerate this film as much as possible, started falling asleep then pinched myself and thought, what tf am I doing here? and walked out!"
	
The drama was not in the form required and the comedy is not funny and some of the footage is meaningless
	
"Nowadays it is like a crime to say bad things against Marvel movies but someone has to tell the truth
This movie is extremely over-hyped. The first 2 hours there was almost no action, it was unnecessary endless dialogs, flashbacks and seconds chances.
When we thought we gonna see some action, it took 30 min only. And then back to aftermath dramas again.
I like dramas and deep stories in the movies but we already know these characters stories. why to over-extend that much?
Acting was empty and going nowhere, CGI was almost none since there was a limited action.
If it was up to me i would wait for torrents buy my gf wanted to see so much and in the end she also got disappointed."
	
"It's like they wrote the script after 3 AM the day before the deadline. This is the worst Marvel MCU film ever. Even Age of Ultron was seriously better than this,"
	
"As Soon as ant man enters the movie with his time travel idea , the movie goes downhill to a point of no return."
	
"I'm sorry but this movie was terrible. Boring and drawn out with some of the laziest writing and script you could imagine. So after the events of infinity war, you half half the population wiped out, Spider-Man, Doctor strange, black panther etc. All turned to dust, iron man stranded on a ship light years away from anything or anyone and we are all thinking where could the movie go from here?, and what is the best the directors could come up with?......iron man gets saved right at the start of the movie then the avengers that are left will just go back in time and get the stones and save the other ones. Ads you kidding me?? My 5 year old nephew could come up with better. Not to mention why not just do that in the last movie then?? They then spend the majority of the movie going back in time to previous movies so we can watch all the crap we've already seen. Just so after 2.5 hours we can get back to the exact same battle sequence with thanos and all the avengers as the last movie except in this scenario they get the stones off him. Pathetic. Why call this endgame?? It's already obvious they're gonna make a million more and never stop making this trash."
	
"My expectations are not above the infinity war, but movie was sucks in many ways, first storytelling was complex, if rat didn't enter microbus, movie wouldn't exist, directors ruined thor(fathor), also we didn't see hulk and black widow's fighting scene, strange played water, thanos became classic villain after infinity war, he was extremely nerfed too, there was only two emotional scenes, last fight was garbage, it's like directors told all performers '' let's join the fight scene concurrently '' fight scene was same with Aquaman movie, only war in Aquaman happened in water"
	
"Frank Capra had a golden rule - a movie can be many things but the number one sin is boring. Endgame - wanted to like it, spent money to like it, and .... boring. long, talkative and not worth the time. 2 hours would be fine, stretched to 3. Comedy was good mostly but not the padding. Long long intro shots of this and that. It finally hit the gold standard of DC. It took itself way way too seriously. So I am disappointed and sad. About right up there with Star Trek - The Motion Picture for boring. I don't like writing this, but ....... boring."
	
"Plot holes everywhere, cheesy lines,basically the average superhero movie and no one sees how bad it is because they're blinded by hype, endgame was a mediocre poorly thought out rushed movie that feels more like a cashgrab"
	
"The half part is boring, and its not really fun to see so many super hero, not a really good inspiring story or no story at all. Glad it finally ends."
	
"After GOT Battle of Winterfell, this movie just can't compete with its 20 minutes of battle. I found myself bored and wondering why it had soo many moments of cheap humor."
	
"This movie is a screw up for all the movies.This scenario of Time Machine changes the whole concept of the world or the Marvel Universe.If the good guys or super heroes can multiple times change the past, then why can't the bad guys or villains.Of course the heroes return back the item so that, they do not to change the time line.Let's talk about what could happen if Thanos or some mad evil scientist do something far more evil deed in the universe with the use of Time Machine.By chance kill Adam and Eve so that they kill all human existence.
Or
Something far greater Sevier he goes on to all planets or universe and kill the first born or species.And so destroys the whole universeNow let's get back to Marvel film.
Since we are talking about Time Machine. There will be all the time 2 people exactly the same, one from that period of time {(for marvel Endgame Movie) past} person and the (Future) person.Captain America (future) goes back in the past and marries Peggy Carter and stays in the past also gets back his unbroken shield to Sam Wilson.
Doesn't this tamper with the past. Having an extra human being also with the actual Captain America Shield. If means the (past) Captain America doesn't have the Shield.Also Nebula (future) kills the (past) Nebula. Doesn't this erase herself from existence. As without the past self, the future self cannot live on.There was also a scene where Iron Man and Ant Man steals the Space Stone.
So a secured and lock briefcase opens with a drop to the ground, without any force. Also Loki disappeared with the Space Stone in 2012 which will also cause problem with the time vortex. As something happened that weren't suppose to happen.Also the Avengers all get their stones without any hassle or fight. Something spicy should have been added.
What I mean is new villain or Jarves should have turned up the alarm for intruders. etc."
	
"Last avengers movie like we knew it. And the everlasting boring one, trying the mange some drama that Neve happened??? Bad jokes... Time travel??? Really? Captain America picks Thor's hammer?
What happened to this movie??? Storyline mediocre... Disappointed and waste of time. 3 hours wasted."
	
I mean come on. Is this actually the best movie you've seen? How is this messy movie better than Guardians 1 or Winter Soldier? This movie shouldn't definitely even be in the top 50 on IMBD.
	
"Infinity War is a Masterpiece and there is no comparison between IW and Endgame more like EndLame.
This movie is full of plotholes , poorly written dramatic scenes and not so funny funny scenes.
Why does Ironman has to die , why he had to wear the gauntlet to snap Thanos when they were going to beat Thanos anyway. Fat thor, useless Hulk, ant-man , captain marvel, hawkeye, captain America , black panther, doctor strange, spiderman , Ironman etc all were there. There was no need of that end snap. I know they wanted to give Iron man a farewell but in a satisfying way, in movie it felt like it was totally useless. And what about Hulk and thanos encounter , oh yeah there wasn't one. I was waiting for proffessor Hulk to step up to Thanos , another disappointment.
Many people liked the last interaction between Hawkeye and Black widow but personally found it cringy and over dramatic with lame writing.
In IW you can clearly see every character was given their share of screen time and justified roles but Endgame was mess .
I have watched IW in theatres 4 times plus many times at home and i would still watch it and enjoy but Endgame i can't.
Many stupid fanboys and casual watchers might find this movie good but the people who likes things making sense and a story which takes you deep into it would feel how unsatisfying this movie is .
Even casting Brie Larson as captian marvel wasn't that bad as this movie .Last words : Infinity War wasn't the movie we deserved but It was the movie we needed.
And this movie (Endgame) is not even close to what it should be."
	
"I thought i was gonna watch the biggest movie of all time but i watched 1 rating piece of crap of movie, coz i had to rewatch previous movies of mcu, repeated scenes of this stupid movie and also did i mention a back to the future version but outer space kinda movie.
One reason i watch movies is to get entertained and humor/jokes like rocket talking to stark and the other funny dialogues btw did they budget cutting or something coz we all know the movie was gonna make more money than disney even have instead they preferred people going to the future and change stuff from before. And one more thing why kill the two biggest mcu money makers?"
	
They open the story and characters very widely so closing the chapter was a mess. Too much drama (poor one) main characters was missing. They gave role of Thor to captain america and hulk as carton green man. Worst avengers and really it's an end game (just a game).
	
"Are you kidding me? I have been waiting years for this movie and they make it for young children. If you're so sensitive for your child wait until it comes out so you can watch it with it rather than complain at the movies. I'm also not impressed with Tony and Natasha's death why does Captain America get to just live his story has been told. I think Tony deserves retirement with his family. Natasha's death could've been a little better. Captain America could've taken it or one of the stronger avengers for the huge sacrifice, but no Tony has to do everything. Couldn't they just use the quantum realm to help them get him back so he could retire?? Come on marvel I know this couldn't be rushed but couldnt the characters get what they deserve?"
	
"Indulgent rubbish. Do yourself a favor and just watch infinity war because this film is boring and by the end, I just did not care anymore!"
	
"Just in few words:
You go to the film thinking it will be even better then infinty war and thor ragnarok ! Both were great, heroic and very entertaining!
But here is what you get from 3 hours of watching:
Thor god of thunder who almost killed thanos n th last movie : a chubby, ruined, drunk addicted man ! His storm breaker can't affect thanos that much!The Hulk : he was afraid and hide last movie so you expect his super comeback with a massive ragging revenge : turned into brucebanner attitude with a zero readyness to any fight and even hurt his arm during the film ... well, the character ruined ...no hulk!Iron man :dissapointed and look like a sick man all of the film ! Then died at the end !Captain marvel : the beauty superman of the mcu ... the unstoppable, the proud , well the one we saw a week before in her own film doing miracles and it was clear the she will save the day and lead the attack in endgame ! When all ruined in infinty war nick fury sent her a message just before he vanished .. it was like well if things reached that level we should summon the super girl .. so what we got at end game: no rule at all , didn't show up for most of the movie , then when showed up she did nothing important , nothing big .. well captain america did better than her I cannot understand how! Even her good look , she cut her hair boy like !!Well what was left in the movie?! The real super characters were Hawkai and captain America who should be by far weaker than the above heros and thean thanos of course !!Final word i watched the movie and asked where are the avengers?!"
	
"Absolutly terrible film. Endgame does not have any of the power, fights, or any part of any Marvel movie. This feels like a horrible one-off DC movie. The story could have been good but WORST follow through I have ever seen. They completely destroy The Avengers from what you have seen so far. The story is slow and seems like they didnt care at all how it ended. The fight scene is rushed and you get to see each person take one swing then they are out. Infinity Wars set up an amazing open end and Endgame ruins 10 years of Marvel films. I am no longer a fan of Marvel. Thanks for the decade long build up to this. And its the last Avengers film, at least with the ones that we know, so they can never fix it. So if youre looking for what you have come to expect from Marvel movie... Look somewhere else."
	
These guys putting up fake reviews! End game is a waste of time and money! Weak story line! Hardly any action for thanos! Many things in the movie unexplained how they happened! Thor made a laughing stock! Why why! Big let down!
	
"Is the movie entertaning? sure. is the movie good? nope. It's actually one of the weakest mcu movies. maybe even worse than black panther and spiderman. and those 2 were really bad.so basically, a rat saved the day. Not Hulk, not tony stark but a rat. oh, and time travel. it's like they wrote the scenario in 1 day, in rehab.It's a pitty that after Infinity War, which was awesome, we got this dissapointing finale.9 stars? lol."
	
"I absolutely love the marvel universe. Reason being, is that although it is magical, powerful, and well super, the movies have still found a way to somewhat be believable as if in our own reality. However, this movie goes beyond that with time travel, and it ruined it for me. Also, I believe that someone sat down and said lets find a way to ruin every character that we have spent the past 11 years building up and making people love them. Same your time and money, watch Infinity War and make up your own conclusion. No matter what you imagine, it is bound to better than End Game."
	
"This movie is a steaming pile of overrated feces.Bad ending , badly written lines.The best thing about this movie is that it kills of that annoying Black Widow."
	
"This is a good movie in terms of all its technical background but there is a lack of feel and energy throughout the film except for the scenes towards the end. You just needs to sit and wait patiently for the final battle.
If you are a Marvel fan then you will enjoy it like any other Marvel films otherwise it can get sort of boring surely an overrated film."
	
"Warning spoilers a plenty.I thought it was utter rubbish, complete drivel. Nearly everything was off and wrong about this bore-fest.Almost nothing happened. It was so boring. Virtually the entire first 90 minutes could have been trimmed to about 15 mins.Pacing was terrible, it lost all momentum at times and was tedious.
The feel of the film, was all over the place, jumping from very dumb childish comedy to attempted serious drama and then to social commentary. It didn't natural have a core or flow to the film.So many stupid, misplaced scenes, such as the girl power nonsense, so contrived.Massive plot holes. I know Time Travel is a very difficult subject to tackle, but this made little sense. Either you cannot change the past or you can? This sometimes does and other times doesn't. If you steal the Stones then try to put them back. In theory they haven't been stolen, as you can't change the past, therefore, how can you put them back? How on earth did Captain America manage to put the Stones back and Thor's hammer and presumably the Green girl? They erased Thanos and the Robot girl in same timeline as well and that didn't effect anything?Apparently you can't kill a baby Thanos, but you can kill a slightly younger adult version of Thanos when he comes to the future that is okay.How did Capt A, put the Stones back at the exact time they left, without interfering with the original operation to retrieve them or changing the past anyway.The cringe worthy comedy was awful. There was a serious tone to Avengers, but this just turned into a cheap gag reel. Thors (a god) getting fat. Hulk getting fans.Corny cheap false scenes with Tony and his daughter, with the terrible music playing at the same time, like some cheap matinee from the 50's.Overall there was no feeling or emotion, the funeral scene was false and contrived.Pepper Potts is now Iron Woman?Spider-man goes back to school, after 5 years away? Really?I saw it with my teenage Daughter, she thought it was crap and we heard most people around us saying the same thing.A real stinker this one. 0/10."
	
"Marvel made time travel a joke.
It is kids time travel with no paradox.
I was hoping a good story line. Worst marvel movie ever with no seriousness of each and every hero."
	
"Honestly felt like a completely different film from Avengers Infinity War. In fact the film had such a different tone from all the Marvel films before.The characters changed, the story line was poor. Incredibly disappointing end to phase three"
	
Tbh its one of the most overrated movies because of these fanboys. You shouldnt even waste your time at the cinemas.
	
"So, i loved infinity warand I was hoping for something better, that would blow my mind.
After 2 hours i was checking my watch, that bever happened to me at an Avengers movie.
I went out of the cinema demandibg my 3 hours back.
This movie is a 6 at best, i gave it 1 just to balnce the stupid high 8,9 rate."
	
"Don't get me wrong, the movie is actually solid in terms of acting and special effects, being it way too long. The big issue here is that 'Infinity War' raised the bar so high, this is just an unworthy sequel. In three hours of movie, you actually get some credible story for no more than 10 minutes. The time-travel solution always looked likely but how it developed was way too predictable. There are way too many plot holes and easy way outs for the story to actually go where it is supposed to go. Some of the heroes are conveniently placed in certain situations out of nowhere and the impending happy ending is always pretty clear to whoever puts some thought rather than just trying to be entertained! I would not watch this again, probably never, unlike 'Infinity War'."
	
"Just too long with too many characters each having on average 10 minutes of screen time. Plot meanders between past (5 years supposedly but even more in one or two scenes quite contrary to expectation) and present with tongue in cheek nod to titles of movies made previously about time travel (back to the future etc). The physics behind time travel is given a pat explanation with the audience expected to swallow some line about how the nature of time changes at the quantum level.
Why is time travel a big deal in this movie? Because mostly everything that is done in the last Avengers film is reversed (with the loss of only a couple of main characters this time around) and Marvel fans can look forward to seeing more of their favorite action heroes in the future. To me, the entire plot is a cop out. Going by this some further plot twist in the next Marvel movie will see the revival of the characters who die in this film.
The acting is mediocre with many of the main characters hamming it up as if on a vacation especially Hemsworth as Thor.
The critics love this movie and it's a global smash hit. To be fair i'm not part of that demographic that is sold on superheroes but I did enjoy black panther and the first Thor film. But this film is about 60-70 minutes too long and can be a strain on the nerves."
	
"Had a lot going on. Expected a lot more emotions to be evoked. Left me asking for more in a negative way.
Moved too fast. Other than the fight scene, which envoked the feel cause of its grandeur, nothing actually makes a lasting impact on you"
	
"Superheroes are supposed to be just that Superheroes. Not humans that are all wrapped up in emotional imbalanced feelings. Plus Thanos the villain is an aazzz kicking machine that literally couldn't be stop. This movie was slower developing than my grandmother's pet turtle. Fortunately, for me I went at midnight to see it so I got a chance to get a 2 hour power nap in so I could enjoy the l last hour."
	
The movie picks storyline at its own convenience. Impossible things become possible at the noise orchestra. My biggest complain is that there is no coherence especially how do you quantity powers of these super heroes ? Just hit smash and do it all over again.
	
"But I want to try to bring the rating down because it does not deserve to be ranked among such movies as The Godfather and Twelve Angry Men.Ill start by saying the movie starts off really strong. Whenever you're dealing with time travel, there's it almost always going to end up messy. There's about a 45 minute stretch in here where the film isn't really coherent, and the way they choose to cover that is by distracting us with a humor, literally a joke every 10 seconds. After a certain point, the movie gets a lot better during the second half.Not as good or as tightly written as infinity war. I think everyone is raving over this movie because it's the end of the marvel franchise, and they did a good job at wrapping everything up. It is no where near one of the best movies of all time like everyone is saying."
	
Seriously not getting what people like in this movie giving 10/10. This movie is horrible and very boring. Not expecting this from Marvel. It seems Marvel tried to make a cocktail of all hit formula in one movie to satisfy all type of audience. The end result - disaster. Worst movie of marvel ever made.
	
"20 movies raised up my expectation from marvel, but the endgame was just a photo album of many actors and actresses who played in a movie with too much dialogues, minimum action scenes, childish plot, flat jokes and predictable events. I had two reservations for this weekend and canceled the other one as soon as I came of theater."
	
I wish that everyone would get back to making action movies and try not to be so PC. There was more blue steel in this movie than zoolander. Not to mention a million plot holes.
	
"I might be the only one to say this but this movie is bad. When I was in cinema I enjoy some moments in the movie however there were things that went completely against canon of Marvel universe as well there are some continuity errors creating even time paradox.Pleae note that the bellow text will contain some spoilers from the movie as well as explanation of the time paradox. I apologize in advance becase some parts might be hard to understand (especially the time paradox occurence) but due to this issues I cannot approve this movie as a good one.There are some spoilers bellow (regarding the movie, not tha comics). First I will make one small shortcut to Avengers - Infinity Wars:****
Thanos snapped his fingers and wipe-out half of the galaxy.
****Please make a not to this because this will be quite important to the time paradox created in this movie.But first the good things:
CGI - there is no denying that a lot of money were put into this moive and it is is paying off;casting - perfect, quite a lot of parts were funny and really enjoyable;captain Marvell - I am really glad that at least some continuity was not broken: many yourubers and people speculated after Infinity War that she will be able to defeat Thanos, I am happy (I also opposed these people in comments) that she was not able to defeat him (there are only three characters that were in the movies that could defeat Thanos when he would not be wearing his infinity gauntlet, and let me tell you captain Marvell is definitelly not one of them, so this is one star more to movie);Bad things:
first half of the movie is without any action, everyone is beaten and the only one who saved this part is fat Thor (for those wondering why he is on Earth go and watch Thor Ragnarok);I don't know why Ant-Man was given such big role and I simply don't even understand it, there are many other surviving characters;(spoiler) Iron-Man dies - why? Pure screenwriting - the only thing that can explain it. Iron-Man was definitelly not the worst hero when it came to generating the profit in Marvell Universe movies so killing him is simply bad;do you know how could our heroes obtain the soul stone? IF and only IF the sacrifice would be made; but the issue is that they did not know that - not even Thanos knew that when he tried to get it in Infinity Wars, so the fact that in two separate film the plot allows to make this sactrifice is really bothering me - Thanos killed Gamora in order to obtain it in Infinity Stones, in Endgame Black Widow sacrificed herself for Hawkeye to get it. Still not seing the issue? What would happen if only one of them would come for the Soul Stone? What would happen if let's say Hawkeye and Thor would come for Soul Stone? Avengers did not know about this condition yet they somehow made the right decission;Worst thing of all (spoiler ahead):
Thanos dies. This does not make sense and it even cannot make sense.At the beginning I wrote that Thanos snapped his fingers and wipe-out half of the galaxy, do you remember? So what would happen if Thanos was killed before he would do this? Exactly - it would create time paradox. Why?
during the movie our reamaing super-heroes travel through time in order to gather the stones themselves so they could revers the effect of what Thanos did;Thanos (in the past) learned about this plot from future Nebula because she was linked to past Nebula (total bs but let's leave this as it is);thanks to past Nebula he was able to travel to his future so he could obtain the infinity gauntlet the easy way;Avengers were able to gather all stones and put them to the gauntlet and in some time during the creation Iron-Man put obviously some mechanism so in case something bad would happen he would be able to get the stones by himself;Iron-Man used infinity gauntlet to wipe-out whole Thanos army as well as killing Thanos himself;WOW - we have time paradox right? Because Thanos who was responsible for wiping out half of the galaxy was killed before he could wipe-out the half of the galaxy thus there was no reason to kill him because no one of avengers knew what he would be planning (they even could not know him) however if there was no reason to kill him nor knowing him he could continue with his plan to gather the stones etc....There are some other major issues in the movie but in the light of the time paradox none of those issues really matters."
	
If someone liked this movie it is because of populism. Infinity war much more better. Scenario was full of inaccurasies. Also war between avengers and thanos was much more worse than the infinity war. I think no one ever read the scenario properly. I hope the next saga will end better.
	
"Overrated and slow as hell. I was yawning whole time during first-half, second half was little better. Don't know the taste of people nowadays creating so much hype for an average movie. I found Alita way better in all aspect action, story, vfx still it is underrated. Eagerly waiting for Alita's sequal soon."
	
"First 2 hours of nothing with stupid humor just to make some children laugh and then while getting closer to the final battle... Still the same one liners to make us laugh... I won't even mention the storyline and it's plot holes... Everything in this movie is wrong...
The Endgame destroys whatever marvel was building for 12 years!!!
It's a disgrace and great disrespect to all our favorite heroes who are portrayed as a parody of themselves (Thor and Hulk especially)...
This film is clearly not made for marvel fans.. Such a shame... Because for me last year's AVENGERS film was simply the best superhero movie of all time...
The Endgame unfortunately was just a family comedy... 😠"
	
Thanos please Snap this Movie is bad Script writing!
	
All over the place & all in all very dissapointing - even some of marvel characters have morphed into embarrassing caricatures. Is it the writers fault or have some of the actors got a bit too much influence? ..... I don't get what planet anyone who gives thos film 5/10 is living on let alone all the 9/10 and 10/10 rating ... The mind boggles ....
	
I don't often write reviews but this movie was so badly done I felt compelled to. That and the overwhelming reviews on here giving it 10/10.The movie completely destroys some of the best built up characters of the series like Thor / Hulk. Even Thanos who was given a brilliant overlay of character traits was discarded with (literally) within the first 15mins of the movie and his return had no character depth at all.The movie also proves Time Travel should never be used as a story botch job. The plotholes are ridiculous including how on earth Thanos is going to make it to the phase of Infinity War given he went to the future and was defeated in the one. That aside how on earth 5 years later all of Peter Parkers classmates are still in high school / the rest of the world literally has not moved on.This gets 3 stars only on the basis that RDJ put in another amazing performance. He should have spearheaded the next phase of storyline as at least an old leader there for inspiration but that of course cant happen now.I haven't felt this annoyed at a movie since I watched The Last Jedi...
	
"Terribly disappointed in the effort. There should have been something more. The movie plods from scene to scene with no real tension, almost as if marvel is giving the viewer the cliff notes on the last 10 years of films. Even the end battle was snooze-worthy, including the mostly useless Captain Marvel showing up as the deus ex machina."
	
"I don't understand guys, seriously. I mean, HOW DARE YOU KILL TONY STARK, EH? This movie was suck. Everyone got their happy ending except Black Widow and Iron Man. I seriously loved this characters. If courage is a super-power, they had the best superpowers!"
	
"The only good thing about the movie is that the time went by fast, but I will admit that I found myself looking around the theater often because some of the scenes were dragged outThere were inconsistencies with the first movie.Thor was a wussThis was the Iron Man show so he could go out like a hero who would sacrifice himself for the ones he loved.Thanos was just as powerful or more so without the Infinity Stones than with. At least it appeared that way to me. The only thing the infinity stones did was give him the ability to wipe out anyone and everyone with a snap of the fingers.Captain Marvel was useless.It almost made it seem like the guys were incompetent until the woman showed up. Then we had the Power Girls convention for a few moments in the middle of the battle with hundreds or thousands coming at them.Biggest waste of my money ever."
	
"I have every Marvel movie, but this one makes me want to sell my entire collection. This movie starts off good enough. You see Stark and Nebula drifting along in space, and the remainder of the oxygen is running out. Then a bright light forms and Tony opens his eyes, and there you see Captain Marvel. She saves Tony and Nebula by bringing them to earth.Now you would think this movie is now going to get really good, but no. Instead Tony points out it is basically hopeless to try and fight Thanos. Then it pushes the story 5 years in the future. Black Widow is in charge in keeping communication open between the heroes. In the meantime, the writers make up obscure BS to keep one of the most powerful heroes away, aka Captain Marvel, while throwing in what-ifs story lines on how to bring everyone back.Basically, the team consists of Black Widow, Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, War Machine, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, Nebula, Rocket, and Thor. So, no you don't see Captain Marvel at all. It's like the writers wanted you to cringe, but no there is more cringe worthy BS they include in this movie. The one that you will notice right away is the typical woman in the refrigerator plot twist. This is when the writers sacrifices the female character to empower her male counterparts, which has been done tirelessly countless times before.You know I'm not even a big fan of Widow, but COME ON! They did the biggest disservice to Black Widow, and to her fan base. She basically does nothing the entire movie and then sacrifices herself for the soul stone. Then the whole male cast sighs in sadness and pushes harder to finish the job. To top it off they attempt the whole female cast rally to help Spider-man, which fails. Then to really hit it home that female characters are worthless, they barely mention the sacrifice Black Widow did for them to get the soul stone. Instead though the entire end of the movie is about Tony Stark's funeral.Here's a suggestion wait until it comes out on blu-ray. It was an utter waste of money to watch it in theaters. Also, way to go Marvel for screwing over female characters yet again! 10 years and 22 movies, and you still can't get it right! Oh by the way only 1 female lead super hero movie!"
	
Trying to avoid spoilers while expressing why so much of this film is just a fan service dues ex machina is just too difficult. A disappointing and cheap end to a decade's worth of popcorn films.
	
"Plot holes,time travel plot has always been bad except maybe God of War 2,from the start it was predictable,and sometimes boring.I expected much more,but infortunately,IW is way better.People that put 9s and 10s are just sheep just because its a marvel movie.Thor and Hulk were just f***d up big time.Thanos compared to the masterfull villain that he was in IW,in Endgame seemed dull and generic.The movie had its good moments and scenes,but mostly the ending counted.A shame that this was the endgame,it could be much more"
	
Predictable movie. Many magic moments as the unexplained moment of captain america in the end. Not so many dead people as hyped(only 2)
	
Complete feminists movie. Several male hero characters were belittled and turned into abysmal failures. Waste of time and money.
	
"I was so excited to see this movie. 1.5 hours later I walked out from sheer boredom. First movie I have ever walked out of. If it was a normal length feature, I would have suffered through the whole thing, but knowing I have another 1.5 hours to go made me want to cry in misery. I left my husband and ran errands ... THAT is how boring it was.Boredom aside, there were so many eye rolling moments that left me surprised with the praise this movie received. AND if you have ever studied physics and the theories of time travel ... I'd suggest you do yourself a favor and leave this for the flat earthers."
	
"Why is this 3 hours movie..If we talk or heard about super hero movie, only action and adventures comes in our mind.. Also Avengers get successful in box office because of action part not bcoz of storyline..after watching 3 hours I feel like I should ask for refund..what a horrible movie.."
	
"I have watched movies and rated them 1/10 without writing a review. But Avengers: Engame build up so much momentum with Infinity War and all that PR upfront, positioning A:E as the ultimate finally of the MCU that the failing of the movie is ultimately that - the sad finally of the MCU.Cinematography: Well done, good CGI as in previous films. Some scenes were shot to dramatic for the actual content of that scene but that's pathos (not a relative of Thanos) in American cinema. Some surprise moments that would are shot perfectly highlighting them (Captain America).Storyline:
*If you don't mind spending the ticket money please watch the movie and decide for yourself.*
Time Travel is a tricky concept with different approaches but there are some theories established and they simply make certain developments during or after time travel impossible / illogical. At this point, I can get behind Stark figuring out time travel with Quantum mechanics. After that the problems for that movie start...A) Illogic of time travel:
The group enables Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos to follow them into the 5 year future where he tries to grab all stones at once. This Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos gets killed in the future which makes it impossible and illogical for all the things happening from the time that Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos left his timeline, e.g. the Infinity War movie and all this Thanos did in his quest for the stones.
If Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos leaves his time (past) into the future and no Infinity War happens, Starks Timeline with a daughter also would not happen. Nevertheless, she keeps on existing after Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos is killed in the future. Zero logic.B) The handling of the stones:
Thanos has his gauntlet specially made in Nidavellir with the power of a star as all stones together hold all of reality. Now all it takes is Stark and some nano-tech to handle them and channel their power? Not realistic by the logic of the MCU explained before.
B.a.) For Ronan (Guardians I) it was almost impossible to wield one infinity stone and the Guardians barely and only survived by splitting the energy between them. The Hulk is almost killed but survives because it's Gamma Ray- okay. But that Stark simply can put on all stones and is not instantly ripped apart makes all previous told content irrelevant and makes this facet of the MCU ridiculous. It's a story line decision to kill of Stark for dramatic reasons but there would have been much better, logical ways. Other characters like a god (Thor) could have handled the stones by the unrealistic Iron Man gauntlet adopting to the persons hand.Over all, a white board, pen and a few hours would have shown the writers where the illogic happens and how to make it right in the sense of simple reasonable logic. This however is an unworthy end to the MCU and previous film."
	
"Never seen such a pathetic movie, they didn't meet my expect ions, it has no comparison with Infinity War. The whole plot lack to build a sequence."
	
"Are you guys serious? Why ruin Thor's character? Why use cheap jokes during war scenes? Why use cheap clichés? Sorry but these ruined my experience, but the story was good BTW."
	
Mighty Thor becomes an obese drunkard & abdicates his throne to some chick.The once Incredible Hulk is now an inane Hybrid 1/2 man 1/2 Hulk & loses his arm.Captain Marvel gets a butch haircut & now looks a lot more like Captain Michael.The moronic writers at Marvel kill off one of the most iconic characters... IronMan!The vast majority of the film is spent dealing with Time Travel & more Time Travel...
	
"How to ruin a masterpiece with a mediocre screenplay movie.
Lets go watch infinity war again and forget this one. We just watch 2 hours of comedy movie, and 30 minutes of classic marvel action sequence, and an end with a tragic death... and you rate this movie over a 9?
I think screenplay was made just for the fan, lets bring back everyone and kill few and everyone will be happy.
So be happy everyone."
	
"The film has too many references to previous Marvel films, and is not friendly to those who are not Marvel fans. General audiences may easily get confused: what is this and why is that? The story is not original either. We have seen too many time-travel films, such as Back to the Future and Days of Future Past. This film does not offer anything new. Besides, the last thirty minutes are kind of redundant, and the overall running time is unnecessarily long."
	
"A box office success, sure, not based on its merits though but rather that of its predecessors. Visually spectacular as we've come to expect from the Avengers franchise (and the only reason for the stars) otherwise unnecessarily long, bordering on boring and full of plot holes. A few endearing scenes and one major scene were the only semi-redeeming factors. Otherwise just SO SO disappointing **SOB**"
	
"How did they get this so wrong?Absolute travesty, and possibly the most disappointed I've ever been with a movie.Lately disappointment is a recurring theme, with a string of average or outright terrible blockbusters."
	
I dont like the movie. It doesn't deserve to be in top 100 movie.
	
Endgame is a movie that makes the audience cry and laugh through the entire three hour long run time. It's laughably bad and sadly disappointing.
	
Worst movie i ve seen since a long time. It traumatized me by forcing me to stay so long in the cinema. Basically a movie designed for kids up to 4y old. (Mentally as well)If today i would have the option to get shot in the stomach 99 times or to go to the cinema to watch avengers i would have 99 problems but going to the cinema wouldn t be one.DON T BUY THE HYPE!!!!! OR AT LEAST TORRENT ITThis rating represents the opinion of 2 persons.
	
"This is the most poorly written of all the Avengers movies. It is action scene after action science with a few lines and a great deal of flashbacks to original Marvel Superhero films. This is the worst time travel movie I have ever viewed. TV Shows such as Outlander and Game of Thrones deal with time travel and flash backs respectively. This movie could have had an hour of superfluous action removed and more money could have been utilized for writers to make the story more concise and give us a chance to say goodbye to our favorite Marvel superheroes. In addition, the costumes were cheesy and as I viewed the film in IMAX I noticed that the costumes didn't fit the characters well. For example, the most ubiquitous costume problem was that their boots appeared to be two sizes too big. The sets were not convincing while the cinematographer would show the whole set then zoom in on a character's oversized boots. By the time, the war with Thanos began during the last 45 minutes it was total chaos with Tony Stark martyring himself for all Avengers and humanity. The writing, in the end, failed to unify all the films. I hoped the writers could pull together the twenty two film collection with a solid introduction, body, and conclusion. The end product was too much action, very little dialogue (except boring hazing), cheesy costumes, poor sets, too many character's whose fate was unclear."
	
"First, half of universe died and the rest can't go on, all heroes was crying without a life sense. Can't believe that. A child on a bicycle angry ¿for what? He was too young to loose the faith. The humanity always rise after a war, even if they lost the war, Germany, URSS, Jews, Spain, Japan. Terrible film message.Second, all the effort to bring out the Captain Marvel before the endgame and with the hope in her to solve the Thanos issue. For nothing, Captain Marvel do nothing... all expectations for nothing.Action only until the end, the rest of the movie was boring.Thank god Marvel is over, no need to know nothing about Marvel Universe. It was almost a bad addiction finally cure."
	
"I haven't nt seen all the Marvel movies, but I've seen some - the Iron mans, the Ant mans, Cpt Marvel. I enjoyed them. I thought I'd go and see what the fuss was about. However this, is so formulaic, ridicilous and boring I couldn't take it for the whole film. I walked out after 2 hours, and it felt every bit as long as that. If you're not a huge Marvel fan already, you may well not like this film, because I feel it's somewhat self-indulgent. It's like an effort to squeeze a bit more money out of fans."
	
"We had 11 years building up to this moment where characters have developed to their best possible selves only to dumb them down more at the last second.Don't even get me started on fat, sloppy, crybaby Thor but the hulk was more useless than in Infinity War. Captain Marvel, who was supposed to be the difference maker, had little to know screen time where she hardly contributed.Obviously, The Avengers come out on top and we all knew this but there were many different directions to make that happen and easily make it spectacular. Bringing time travel into any movie is tricky but when you completely change prior movie's outcomes it left me wondering if the buildup was necessary. Way too many alternate realities created and plot holes that just made for a rushed and confusing plot.Black Widow sacrifices herself to get the Soul Stone and everyone is sad and agrees they can't get her back even with time travel because those were the rules to get the stone. BUT then Gamora who died in Infinity War for the Soul Stone comes back no questions asked!?!Also, really disappointed in Thanos's character. In my opinion he is one of the best villains of all times and an absolute mastermind who was beyond interesting in Infinity War. In Endgame he has zero personality and was all of a sudden more powerful without the infinity stones than with.It felt like they wanted to make this movie as emotional as possible but it was so rushed and confusing that during those death scenes I was just ready for it to be over.Hopefully phase 4 will come back strong with Thor teaming up with Guardians of the Galaxy"
	
"Having come out of Infinity Wars blown away, to then be greeted with this as the follow up was a complete and utter let down! The plot holes that are opened up when time travel is introduced just ruins the full experience. The fact that at the end they could just pull the stones from the glove is ridiculous, did they not think about doing that when Mantis has Thanos under her control in Infinity wars?? This story could have been taken a whole different direction, with a lot more action to obtain the stones back from Thanos! Thor was made to be weak, Captain Marvel was barely there and the HULK was just all wrong! The comedy was about the only saving grace for me."
	
"I have read better fanfic stories than this. It feels like the Russos tried to fix their plot holes by digging deeper. The humor was so cringy and nonsensical! If in a room full of 500 Marvel fans, only 5 persons laugh at the fat jokes, then you must ask yourself if it was really necessary. Because yeah, Thor, grieving and hopeless, became fat and... THAT WAS THE JOKE! Tony, almost a skeleton, inspires sympathies, but Thor, who is fat, is a joke. He's fat! That's the actual joke! WTF Russos??
The time travel doesn't make any sense. At all. No matter how many times it's repeated throughout the movie, it simply doesn't.
Can we also talk about Captain America whose character evolution went downhill?
Bruce Banner with the body of the Hulk is... I just don't have words anymore.
I give up. It was a terrible movie, filled with plot holes and regressive character dev. I lost 3 hours of my time I'll never get back and i'm sad that 10 years of being a hardcore MCU fan ended with THAT.
Side note: Scott Lang and Peter Parker are A++++ Not enough to save the movie though."
	
"Completely shocked at how bad this is. Thought marvel did a great job with infinity war, with character development and tying the story all together.Endgame is the exact opposite. Back to the cliche terrible jokes, no character development. Focus on the worst actors, almost no screen time for all the most talented members of the new marvel cast.Back to the drawing board required for next avengers movie.Genuinely awful film!! So disappointed."
	
It was everything for me. The way they linked all the ends was marvelous. I found all the happiness and sadness at the same time. Love you Iron man 3000. And now we all do know who's Captain. And sadest thing was to lose widow. And I still love Red witch She was incredible. At the end Thank You Marvel.
	
"I don't know where to start!!
Plot holes all the way through,
Two of the strongest Avengers might as well have not bothered! Thor and Hulk are rubbish in this movie. Danvers? Forget it. Saved tony smashed a ship, but Thanos can still throw her about?? So we travelled through the quantum realm, but had the time stone early..... why not use that? The Mjolnir and Caps Shield change of ownership just annoyed me. But my biggest Disappointment was how they didn't use Thor or Hulk. Hulk has been sold out massively in the MCU and it sucks. I could go on all day. The more I think about it, the less I like it. That's me done with Marvel now. RIP Stan Lee."
	
"...and pull the hype train over.
Amazing fun, stunning spectacle great performances especially RDJ.
It's just not the whole sum of its parts.
Lots of great parts but not cohesively held.
Too much Comedy with one character essentially now just full comedy relief.
The most ridiculous coincidences and a couple of plot holes.
You will laugh, you will get gut punched and for some you will cry, but then you will wonder what really happened in that 3 hours.
Did it need 3 hours? No.
Is it better than infinity war? No.
Will you enjoy it? Definitely."
	
"What to say, it's a good movie... Okay? We get it. Lots of big name actors, special effects, and stuff. But c'mon, it's ANOTHER super hero movie, you know what to expect, and you'll have to sit there for 3 hours to get your 1-2 cool scenes that you paid money to see. Having said that, it's a good movie, I don't think anyone will debate that. But I honestly feel like the treatment of some of the characters, what they turned them into for this movie, it just doesn't work for me personally. I think it got RAVE REVIEWS because it's a big achievement, a capstone, a sendoff. And it *IS* a big deal in that way, but as a standalone, objectively-analyzed, critically-evaluated superhero movie, it's just about as good as any of the other dozen or so that came before it."
	
"This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. Visuals, the actresses and actors, and plot. Everything linked up. I love this film and would recommend it to anyone."
	
"Waste of money and time full of depressive heroes who cry like little babies for 5 full years. The prior is 100 times better than this crap with mediocre lines, but I guess that this is what the masses ask for..."
	
When you kill off two of the main characters the ones that weren't sjw and promote social Warrior BS I'm done. This was my end game don't waste your money your time those are two things it's hard to get back. And some sisters in the Marvel Universe none of us can go back in time what a joke.
	
"Confusing use of time travel, tried to be too much of a comedy, poor acting throughout. Half-decent end fight scene which is why it managed to get some stars from me."
	
"I am very disoppointed ,actualy i know ,at the end if infinity war ,they gonna make it mess with ant man and time travel ,hardlu you see other charcters ,the way they make hulk off realy mess"
	
"The spine of a movie is the scenario and similar to the recent popular superhero movies, this movie's is jelly. It does not include creativity and smartly combined events.First of all, weak script writers hold on to time travel concept in order to make
writing easier with lack of creativity. They do not need to stick onto a logic - they can just explain everything by time travel. This movie has Terminator Genisys impressions which I think was the least fun to watch of Terminator series.Second, I hate repeated usage of Deux ex Machina in these superhero movies. This a concept which should strictly be avoided due to lacking creativity, but trending contrarily. At the end of Batman vs Superman; while they were both fighting against Doomsday and losing, Wonder Woman pops up and saves their day.
In Avengers, when the superheroes were losing against Thanos' spaceship, Captain Marvel comes from the space unexpectedly and fragments the spaceship into parts. Why was she not around until they were beaten enough and lose hope? The writers do not leave us without a logic expression: She was busy saving other planets. But Captain Marvel is not the only superhero to poup at the end. Zounds of good superheroes enter into the scene from some magical gates to fight against the bad army. (impressions from Lord of the Rings Ghost Army - but it had creativity and logic within)1 sentence summary of the movie: While good heroes are losing against bad, many other good heroes appear somehow and they all save the world together.There is another controversial trend rising : Instead of creating black superheroes from scratch (which requires creativity), white heroes hand the superhero job over to black people. In Spider Man into the Spider Verse, the regular Spider Man hands the job to a black youngster.
This movie follows the trend, too. At the end, Captain America assigns a black guy as the new Captain America.
However, we are not seeing movies with black superheroes in the lead role. (Always side roles)
If the filmmakers are sincere, the lead superheroes in following movies must be acted by black people (especially Spider Man and Captain America),
otherwise this trend is just a forced gesture.Oh, the movie also does not skip emphasizing another cliche: the of the importance of family.So that the filmmakers have $400M to spend on a movie, I believe they can also spend some money, effort and time on creating authentic, non-cliche scenarios without cutting corners.If you are just seeking a vast variety of superhero collision without thinking much, go see it.
But if you are seeking a movie with an original, creative scenario keeping focus on a particular character (as in Terminator 1&2, Avatar and Alita), avoid wasting 3 hours of your life."
	
How can Avengers travel back to the past and why Thanos is powerful even don't have any stone. That movie is illogical at all.
	
"Please don't waste your time with this one. This movie was the worst, most cringeworthy waste of a good story I have ever seen."
	
It looked like a cartoon movie. I think the director showcased in the movie whatever he saw in his dream.
	
"After watching Infinity war, I was looking forward to much more this time but this movie fall flat on the face.SPOILER ALERT - dont read further if you have not seen the movie.So many plot holes from the beginning.Why we need antmen to remind people about time travel? Thats the first thing people will think if something like that ever possible. Instead they could have made use of ant men and goto quantum world to rebuild the atoms of broken stones.So much screentime given to side charecters. Where do people go after they vanish? And wouldnt they be confused after they return to a different timeline? Or they will just jump into fight? Wouldnt be half of Thanos's soldiers be back again fighing other avengers?Why world is still deserted after 5 years? People stopped working?How Captain A is able to use Thors Hammer?Whats the use of Thanos killer weapon? Just to kill unarmed and weak Thanos?Why Thanos was given no screentime? I would have loved to see him more often in 3 hrs movie.Why Thanos is so dumb? Even after getting all the stones he mindlesly fight and not use any power of stone? Even when he already seen his future and know how to use stone power.Just a fanboy movie. Waste of my time and money."
	
"Far from what one would expect from a movie with such a budget. Same costumes, predictable storyline, few of the actors even act. Sondtrack? There isn't one. Even the few jokes can't save the day. The whole thing is sometimes even boring! Waste of time and money.Marvel lost me, my family and most of my friends. One star for trying."
	
"Overwhelmingly boring!!! Thanos the farmer, really? This is a soap opera!! Don't waste your time and money watching this BAD JOKE!!"
	
"*Spoilers Ahead*
To start with the review I'd like to say.... highly disappointing movie.
Wasn't at all upto the mark
They should change the genre of this movie from sci-fi to just drama....the majority of this movie contained just sentimental stuff....
It felt like I was watching a serial rather than watching a Science fiction movie which supposed to have action in it
95% of movie contained no action at all
The climax even wasn't upto the mark
When all the superheroes of this movie finally assembled u will be expecting something grand but nothing happens
There is no individual action scene of any of the superheroes even the supposedly mighty captain marvel has hardly for 5 mins featured in this movie
The sacrifice of Iron Man was kind off justified and also predictable
Nothing about Hulk!!
To conclude I'd like to say....one the worst movies of MCU till now
Even if they had extended the movie for 4 hrs with 1 hr fighting scene people would have still gone to watch it and would have appreciated more."
	
"What can I say but WOW! This has to be one of the most boring movies that I have ever seen in my life. I loved Infinity War but Endgame on the other hand is utter trash. Way too many fanboys overlooking major plot holes.
Personally I would give it around a 6. However, seeing how many people are giving this a 10, to try restore some semblance of balance, I will give it a 1."
	
This is the best worst marvel movie i ever seen so much lag
	
"Usually I don't bother writing reviews. But .... how can such a thin manuscript and a CGI be allowed to come on the big screen. But if you think this is a movie worth 8.9, then be my guest... I'll watch Godfather in the meantime.."
	
Too many plot holes. The first 90 minutes were really slow. The next 90 minutes were too rushed. Infinity war was wayyyyy better.
	
"It is overrated movie - and not in the same level as infinity war. I think the two movies could have been merged into one 3 hrs movie and spare us the hype of 13 years old fans all over the world.It is not worth it.Most of the parts are slow paced and dull, and the action sequences are not new or even surprising.Full of cinematic cliches."
	
"Watched this effort and was disappointed. In fact, the last three efforts from the writers and directors of Winter Soldier have been sorely lacking. Where is the superb action in these films? The entire fights on the ship, highway, and elevator in Winter Soldier were not only intense, but they were exciting to watch since it showed the great skills of both Cap A and Black Widow. It also showed them winning. In Infinity and Endgame many fights were depressing, except the short fight in Endgame. Winter soldier also had a great story, where many difficult situations were sorted or calculated by Cap A and Black Widow being skillful fighters and brilliant strategists. In Endgame, the creative and brilliant science prodigy Iron man looked inadequate. The writers could have had him, together with Nebula, thinking creatively to get back to Earth using the Milano instead of cheating the storyline by having Cap. Marvel suddenly appearing. What about Antman? The film had a rat conveniently pressing the right controls to have Scott Lang fart out of the van. Wow, what a plot convenience!. Surely, Scott could think of something in five hours to get out of the time vortex. Another superhero made to look inadequate. Let's get to Hulk and the tragic storyline of the God hero Thor. The former had no chance to avenge his defeat directly at the hands of Thanos. Surely, the immense strength of Hulk together with the brains of Banner could figure something out. And Hulk's reaction to Black widow's death was pitiful. He did not even get angry and tip over the edge. Come on, what is that? Boy, after the heroic turn of Thor in Infinity War, here he is reduced to a fat God that cannot even defeat a Gauntlet-less Thanos with the Stormbreaker and Mjolnir. I feel bad for the brilliant Hemsworth, who had a great turn in Dark World (went to his post-Avengers Loki for help with defeating the Elf. This was brilliant storytelling) and Ragnarok. The writers had him lose twice to Thanos. Where is the satisfaction in that! Where was the satisfaction of both Scarlett Witch or Nebula not having Thanos suffer greatly for him killing Vision or abusing the latter for many years, respectively. The storyline should have been better constructed. Cap A could have had a better fight with Thanos. He is a master strategist and fighting soldier. Couldn't the writers have had him training for Thanos in the last 5-6 yrs. Improving his strength and getting to know everything about Thanos. Couldn't they have had him helping the weak through fighting the bad guys in the meantime, like Hawkeye. Hawkeye's story was good, as the film resembled Signs to s small extent in concentrating on a small family situation and why it was necessary for him to reverse the snap. The last three films have been rushed. In Civil War, everything was supposed to be ok after Cap writes a letter to Iron man. Come on. Take time to write a great story that these films deserve. To have all the heroes return in the last 15 mins is pathetic. These heroes deserved more time. Gosh, Okoye's fighting skills were not even displayed as well as they were in Black Panther. The hype far exceeds the fun factor in this movie and the past two. Not been satisfied with Marvel since WS. Have not bothered to watch Antman 2 or Captain Marvel. This was bad."
	
"MCU first killed Jarvis, then killed Tony. I hate MCU. MCU and Disney are spoiling Marvel characters."
	
"I don't know if I would like to go to another marvel film after that - the writing was really bad!
Why did Captain Marvel didn't do that instead of Iron Man? She is pure energy...
Why did Dr. Strange didn't opened a huge portal for Thanos and took them elsewhere?
Or more simply why no one let Strange the time-stone and he just make a milion years go by on Thanos army.
What happened to Thanos' ideology of saving the universe? Suddenly he just wants to destroy it?"
	
"Time travel destroys any film...time travel doesnt exist in the physical world..its an invention of writers and authors to close plot holes and impress audiances...so, any film or book containing time travel, IS A MESS! so, i dont see any reason to grade this movie more than 2 stars...cgi, fights, ok , but a real good movie, must have a believable story! for me, sorry it didnt work...
question...why thor and hulk had to be humiliated so much in this movie ? why toni stark had to die? to offer the framatic essence to the story?is this the end of marvel heroes?"
	
"Welcome to MCU in 2019 where feminism, cultural Marxism and humorless comedy rules.The movie started beautifully with Clint losing his family... too bad that was as good as we were gonna get.Russo shows up as a dude telling about his date... with another dude... cuz Of course... that makes sense... half the world died but that lifestyle can't ever get enough....Captain Marvel is still annoying and unwatchable - oooh! She squints! Just about the worst actress to ever play an MCU character.., thankfully she's barely in... reduced to a horrible Deux Ex Machina plot device - which makes no sense - basically her MO is: Earth was attacked by Thanos twice, and both times she was chasing babes on the other side of the universe...If time travel wasn't bad enough they also go 5 Years Later on us... and basically break every known rule about either narrative device - so Peter disappears for 5 years but goes back to the same high school class? His friend is there waiting for him still looking as young as when he left??? Did they both disappear???Cap is given a silly ending - the guy who would never let any evil ever happen without fighting til I can do this all day basically lived for 70s in obscurity playing hooky with Peggy Carter
Also - he notices and appreciates his own behind cuz of course!Hulk looked stupid, acted stupid and woulda been the biggest betrayal of a character arc if it wasn't for them reducing Thor to a fat crying drunk... who's still good to battle but just a sap Whenever the plot demands...The scene with all the female heroes was vomit inducing - yeah that makes sense the world is turning to crap and Hope is actually inside the van helping ant-man but why not go all #Resist meets #Metoo cuz #ImWithHers 2020 - I was surprised Kamala Harris didn't play a half East Indian Half Wakandan warrior with the power to go down on her knees anytime she needed a Job in politics...Since there was not enough plot mechanics in time travel and 5 years later they also added consciousness sharing doppelgangers and Gamorra from the past now being stuck in the present so...At least Downey Jr, Evans and ScarJo are free to never have to step foot in this terrible manipulation of fandom which had its peak with the great infinity war but ended with the worst marvel movie this side of captain marvel..."
	
"The plot was messy, and so vast, with so many amazing characters, who were all simply diluted into one giant mess of a movie. Didn't really find the humour amazing either."
	
"Well. Went to see it opening night and came out so disappointed. Was reading reviews when going in (without the spoilers) that were so great only to be hugely disappointed!!! No spoilers in this review as none are really necessary. To much time on empty characters (Hawkeye), way to long to bring back the half that are gone so most of the movie was wasted with slow plots that will be destroyed in the end. The captain ending is stupid. How many holes are there now!!! And boring hulk!!!! Why???? Infinity war was on a different level and this just fell off from the beginning. I felt like when I watched the NEW Star Wars movies. Total waste and let down. I think they forgot what got them this far and just caved to making the almighty dollar in the end."
	
"Waited for the endgame ever since I left the theatre after infinity war. I really wanted to enjoy the movie, I even cheered for all the cliche stuff that was shoved in the film as what you would call fan service. But what the writers did to the fans was really disrespectfull. They wrote off all the heroes whose contract is done with marvel in the most rediculous way possible. Oh make hulk all green , sacrifice black widow for no reason, make captain America old, uselessly old, and please don't get me started on the unnecessary killing of Iron man the God father of the what so called Marvel Cinematic universe. They wanted us to give up Our old heroes to make way for their new ones, but just because we are fan they can manipulate us the way they want, but just because we are fans this is the one thing we won't do. It's not easy for a fan to let go of his hero and move on. We deserve a better end than that, their heroes deserve a better end than that insult. For heaven sake even Loki deserve a better ending than that. As a fan I was ready to allow all the none sense the story had, but insult me and take away my favorite hero and I will eat you alive. I will allow the whole concept of time travel thing, but let's go through the logic they had to fix everything. They would go back in time and steal the stones from different timelines bring them to the future snap their fingers bring everyone back, okay after that it gets stupid they will return the stones back right when they took them, wait won't that be putting the stones for Thanos to take again in his own timeline to snap his fingers and repeat the loss AGAIN. Why wouldn't they just go to the past destroy one of the stones once and for all. That would have at least saved black widow. Why would iron man snap his fingers why didn't he use the power of the stones and kicked Thanos ass at least that would have given us the satisfaction of revenge. How did Thanos get all the pym particles to get almost all his planet on earth through time travel in quantum realm when the avengers themselves had only enough for ONE ROUND TRIP. Where did the Asgardians come from. Didn't Thanos destroy their whole ship in the start of infinity war. How did the valkirey get her white horse for heaven sake have some respect for our heads and what good did the flying horse do really Nothing. Why make Thor this miserable and useless, that's not fair to his fans at least, why give him 5 minutes chat with his mother when it does nothing to his morals or affect the story at all. Same for the starks father son meeting absolutely meaningless. Where was Thor and iron man when Thanos beat the hell out of captain America, sleeping ?!! The end fight scene was terrible in the least. Single fight no unity at all even though they were all there and what became of Thanos they did better fighting him when he had the stones now that he is without them he becomes invincible why?!! Just to kill away Iron man?!! And don't get me started on the boring out of context gay conversation captain America has with an unknown and why he gives his shield to falcon just because he is black, leaving Baky his almost brother behind. The girl power scene was crab and too imposed. Spider man comes back after 5 years to find his friends still at high school ?!!! You ruined it all Marvel ,you destroyed my 11 years of entertainment with a really horrible ending that just serves you and not the dedicated fans whom made this possible for you. That is a promise from me and I believe from many other fans WE WON'T BE SUCKED UP IN YOUR WORLD OR UNIVERSE OR WHATEVER AGAIN. THAT IS IT. FIND NEW FANS."
	
"Last 30 minutes was overly sentimental, however, there were some scenes that made me have goose bumps. It was not what I expected."
	
"The avengers: End game movie is the worst out of all the marvel movies. With an horrible end and a bad plot. For a normal, sane person this is a too wacky movie with a lot of weird twists. The only really good thing in this movie is the avengers theme song that gives the movie a little spark in the total darkness that it is in. If you consider watching this movie DON'T."
	
"When Infiniti War ended by Thanos winning, I hated it. Though I new that this year's Avengers Endgame is going to be going back to the past etc. But never thought they will end it by Iron Man's death and the Captain's retirement. Who's going to save the world when another Thanos is born in the Universe?
Thank You."
	
"Time paradoxes are glossed over, bad story writing, completely wasted my time"
	
"First off, phenomenal cast. I can't think of another movie that had even half the headlining talent that this one did. Still, it just plain sucked. Terrible dialogue, boring and repetitive special effects, and longer than Gone with the Wind.Also, I detest Gweneth Paltrow. I'd have given a 2nd star if they'd killed her, but they didn't so I didn't."
	
Wow! What a POS movie...So much talking. So much crying.. So much boring no action garbage. These high scores must be paid off. Don't believe the reviews. Stopped watching in one hour..and yes that first hour was painful. I can't imagine fighting thru another two hours. What a shocker. A three hour movie that stinks. Who's idea is it to make movies three hours?!?! Most of them are garbage.Skip this at all costs
	
"Thanos original purpose was to give his bride The Dead itself, the half of universe´s lives, as wedding gift. The evolving thing was too sense as a goal for a mad cosmic being as Thanos, anyway none care about it. The old comics are covered with dust and oblivion.I couldn´t stand the Captain America having the power of lightning and masterfully using Mjolnir, like he was expend training all his life with it. Totally sickining. He is worthy well he just need it to throw it, and wield it, just like that.Hawkeye the forgoten advenger was in a crazy rol, who cares? Where were Adam Warlock and Magus and even more The Living Tribunal?Why name this movies Infinity war? with the excuse of the alternate filmic universe, very powerful plots are crumbling, one after another.Maybe that happens when you expect that new things overcome the old ones, or even that match just a little."
	
Watching this movie has me seriously thinking of inventing my own time machine. I would either go back and prevent the Russo brothers from making this movie or at the very least go back in time and not buy tickets to this movie. All my hopes that had been built up for a year were shattered. Dropped. Smashed. Shattered.
	
"Disney's grand attempt cash grab, trying to kill off characters while pandering to fan theories on who should live. Movie doesn't deserve a high rating because it is not theatrically complex. Time travel is a terrible cop-out for a real plot device."
	
"Fist I would like to say I don't generally love superhero movies. And I'm not really I big MCU fan and stuff like that.All that being said this was not a good movie.
It felt very predictable and formulaic the it was just like every other superhero film I've watched except a few with a few different villains. I thought they made the Hulk character really stupid. The he's not interesting if he doesn't get mad that's what makes the character interesting. Also the whole time travel thing didn't make any sense and just felt like other scenes and different movies.Then there were so many plot holes. Like isn't the timeline now all messed up? If you like action It's average. If you like story it's pretty bad. If you want something original you've come to the wrong place."
	
"For me, very boring and the characters persona as they were before just ruined in this movie.
I have greatly enjoyed every Marvel movie except this one."
	
"Avengers: End Game is long, boring, and predictable--with an endless amount of fan service. The humor in this movie just doesn't get a laugh. I cannot express how disappointed I am with the conclusion of 10 years of movies. I'm shocked this film is actually getting good reviews. This will be the last Marvel movie I see on opening night. I cannot help but think this is the beginning of the end for the MCU. It was good while it lasted."
	
"Cheesy and dumb. They could have done so much with this movie, but completely failed. There was WAY to much comedy and PC moments. Definitely a waste of time and money."
	
"I honestly don't understand what people liked in this movie. There was too much inspiration from a third class chick flick, with completely useless emotional scenes from super heros who don't really inspire any emotions. Acting and dialogs were also terribly executed. The movie could have easily be completed in half an hour without losing any content."
	
Not fair to Thor. 5/10 Cheesy jokes and So conclusion. Just A Business Movie on Super Hyped Fan base.
	
"No Thanoscopter
No Thank You
Get your stuff together Marvel"
	
"I must have watched Infinity War a dozen times, so as you can expect I was expecting big things from this movie. How wrong was I. Shockingly disappointing. The people on here giving 9 and 10's must be scoring infinity war by mistake. The film was so boring and the story was rubbish. CGI took a massive step back for me. I will not be watching this dribble again. Well unless it's on cable tv at Xmas day in 4 years time and I'm too full of dinner to get up and change the channel."
	
"No single fight scene at the start! Talk too much entire film! More like romance than an action blockbuster! Disappointed for action movie fans! Wait 2 hours more to watch the Avengers assemble and fight with Thanos! Most intense fight scene is Thor team up with Captain America to fight with Thanos! Many people asking why Captain America can use Thor hammer and ax! Actually who care! Silly time travel heist concept! And Marvel Studio's movie nowadays won't stick to previous film storyline anymore, they like to write whatever script they like! Good movie should not bored audience! This movie certainly not that kind of movie! I actually crying when Hawkeye race with Black Widow to jump off the cliff suicide! So silly but touching! Action scene really cannot outclass Age Of Ultron! Lastly really hope Anthony Mackie won't takeover Captain America character! Lol!"
	
This movie kinda sucked. Even worse than most other Marvel movies. It was just a mess. They shouldn't have even tried to explain their time traveling/dimension jumping. Quantum physics? Really? Ok. This movie overall is a comedy. There are a few pretty funny jokes. But most movies are much better than this movie.
	
"First thing is Thor is a stronger character that can make huge changes without stark's Death
Second thing is captain America can have Thor's power because oden whispered to his hamer that one will have it only
So the mistakes I saw there was Thor was useless and captain America got his power
Third thing is captain marvel didn't make any changes so the purpose of this character is making money !!!!"
	
"BORING!!! TOO LONG!!! Two of the main characters, changed for wearing diapers. DISAPPOINTING."
	
More than half of the movie is boring with a very bad script
	
"My kids were very excited to see this but I was more apprehensive. Really, the film is far too long, just unnecessarily. Parts of this film were very boring and were an ideal time for a cinema snooze! It had so much more potential but directors lost site of their aim. Disappointed."
	
"It is the worst scenario ever . How could you defeat the most powerfull character in the marvel universe as he is child ? And All of the logic errors ?? Making Infinity War :
MARVEL PARADOX:
1-In the First movie kill many important characters
2-Oh no ! we can't get money without them we have to save them !
3-Save them with silly time machine or incredible things
4-Show off them for 10 minutes .
4-Repeat"
	
"Poor cgi for big budget movie! Nothing special in acting, regular things... Copy story from other movies like Inception and Star Trek.. Poor cinematography and soundtrack! General nothing special, nothing unique!"
	
Kids wrote plot for the movie. Ppl are getting made for nothing
	
It was really bad. Incredibly slow. The plot was full of holes and they pretty much destroyed some of the best characters ever.Just a really bad movie.
	
Problem with time travel is if your not careful you make the whole plot impossible to believe. End game doesn't even come close to tieing up its loose ends. The remaining avengers act selfishly and arragently to the point you want them to fail.Thanos did nothing wrong. I hated this film.
	
"I was really hoping to watch a good movie. I have seen all Marvel movies and was excited with the 10 star reviews. But this movie is basically garbage. A lot of characters doing random things. There was no interesting story line. The emotional scenes did not have any impact. The action scenes will leave you with a headache. What amazes me is people giving a 10 star, please be honest to yourself and rate correctly."
	
"My rating is purely based on the ending. The movie was probably a 5 at best imo. There were cool parts of course, like Cap wielding the hammer, fat Thor, Ironman and some other stuff too.But the overall movie did not live up as far as I'm concerned. It never followed through with the epicness of the last one and it never lose enough from an emotional standpoint.Captain America deserved an honourable death, not becoming an old fart.Thor deserved to find himself after the depression, especially after meeting his mom and then die an honourable death too.Hulk deserved redemption after the awesome scared angle from Infinity war.Ironman got an awesome ending of course.Personally, I feel that Endgame should have provided more of an end - true finality - instead of continuously trying to build for the next Marvel run."
	
Not sure why they included all that time travel and extended fight scenes for. I think the advertisement was pretty effective when Tony Stark rolled up in his Audi. Just seems a bit overkill for a car commercial you know.
	
"The movie unsuccessful attempted to get sensual but it was way from it ,it felt like a roller coaster with the sequence of action, too many things happening in a short segment that will throw you off from enjoying the movie , it is too long and that tells you something , too many characters , lol you will get lost, like wow this a way odd. If you decide to watch it avoid the 3D version. Honestly , it was way below my expectations ."
	
"The 10/10 reviews baffle me. HOW on earth? People using words like Perfect Amazing Brilliant need their heads wobbled. It's the worst marvel film made, with more plot holes than Swiss cheese, insulting the intelligence of real fans.
I'd like to hear what Ruffalo, Hemsworth and Downey Jr feel about having marvel screw their characters over like they did."
	
"****SPOILER WARNINGS FOR AVENGERS: ENDGAME****Disney's apparent quest to make male characters less traditionally masculine and female characters more so, results in a convoluted tale whose biggest sacrifice is a coherent story.Start with the disasters that are Thor and Hulk, the two characters above all known for their great strength. Both of them are castrated of their power in this film.Thor's last two films have been a comedic spoof of his character. Late night television couldn't even spoof him anymore, for they have done it themselves. The god of thunder is now a useless, emotional wreck drunkard, not just for one gag, but for the entirety of the film. Hulk, made famous for his struggle with violence and bouts of destruction likewise is reduced to comedic fodder, including a joke about his inability to Hulk-out with rage anymore.To a lesser degree Captain America is another emotional wreck and runs a counseling group. In it, we are sure to have Disney praise gay dating to check all the PC checkmarks. At the end, he passes his shield to Falcon and the five-pointed star is clearly inverted in the shot, which doesn't help Disney's reputation for adding devilish or cultish symbolism in films.The main women in the story, with the exception of Nebula, are depthless, Mary Sues - the new business model of Disney and other uncreative Hollywoodians. Danvers, Natasha, the witch, Okoye, Gamora, Wasp, Valkyrie, all overflow with competence. There is little to say about them other than they are all clones of the same character, filled with all the strength and competence lost by Thor and Hulk.The film drags on for seeming hours while we are shown what an apocalyptic wreck the world has been for five years since The Snap. Why is it apocalyptic? Who knows. There are still 3.5 billion people on earth. Has everyone just been in counseling while baseball stadiums collapse and are overrun with foliage?The movie, devoid of originality in every scene, is filled with cliches about how it's gotta work and other painful dialogue. The climactic moment, where Stark *literally pickpockets* the stones from Thanos in about two seconds, is a cliche overdone ad nauseum. The protagonist scuffles with villain and is defeated in the fight-but surprise! The protagonist produces the thing he snuck from the villain. And the villain has his mouth hanging open. And so do the viewers who can't believe they paid to see *another* movie with that climax.In short, Disney has about killed the Marvel franchise."
	
"Now, that a week has spend after his releasing ay theatres, i'll explain muy question in Pesce.
After five or six years after this, could there be something about this movie that makes recomended, else of his hype and the marketing?I Am not a really Marvel or DC's fan, but i loved some of their movies such as; DC's: Dark Knight all, Wonder Woman, Man on Steel, Shazam. And Marvel's: Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr Strange, Winters soldier, and of Course: Infinity War. But i was waiting a lot about this, i has too big expectations, them go to the midnight releasing and i found a fast food product of movie; horrible script, horrible performance, stupid logic, terrible story.
Really is this the current cinema's way?
I ll'get out of this awful and cheap movie theather."
	
"There is no way there can be so many legit 10 votes for the movie. Seems like a hoax to me.It was so bad. Infinity war was way better.I went to see it partly because of the high rating, never trusting imdb ratings again. The studio must have fixed some high ratings to induce ticket sales.Massive waste of time and money."
	
"Everything that could go wrong went wrong. We've had countless time travel movies before, but this one had the worst mechanics by far...and by mechanics I mean there were no mechanics whatsoever. Time travel could no whatever you wanted to as long as it helped the plot advance even if it did not make any sense and came without any consequences. 1 hour into the movie there were already so many loopholes and inconsistencies that I stopped counting. Thanos turned from a lion into a kitten (to avoid saying another word) and your typical evil character. It was so bad that it actually got me laughing when Tony Stark was dying...now that's an achievement on its own. So much time was spent around our protagonists and yet they never felt as thin as they did now. Infinity War was a much much more satisfying movie. Never thought I'd say this, but I'd rather watch Batman Vs Superman over this crap. Now all that I hope for is that it does not break Avatar's box office record or else that would be the joke of the century.
Don't get me wrong though, I still highly recommend watching it....for all those below the age of 12...because that's how immature you must be to ignore all of the movie's flaws."
	
"Basically; nothing new happens. The avengers decide to go back in time to (unsuccessfully) tug at our nostalgia heartstrings. They revisit past scenes of previous movies for the first 2/3rds of the movie.The final third is just a big battle which we've seen a thousand times prior. In fact, it's the battle from infinity war - probably with recycled graphics. The only decent part of this movie was Caps ending, there was a certain satisfaction to seeing the man who fought others battles in a world he didn't quite fit in, finally get what he always wanted; a normal life with the woman he loved.Other than that, hilariously bad and overrated culmination of the marvel universe. The characters we have watched grow over the years become shells of their older selves. Key moments are misused. The famous Thanos 'snap' is overused. The heart wrenching Spider Man moment is replicated horribly. Repeated catchphrases felt hollow.The Black Widow sacrifice yielded no emotional impact, at all. The Iron Man sacrifice was pointless for the sake of being pointless. We've seen all of this before. I could go on and on about the problems with this movie but you get the idea."
	
Don't waste your money. Watch it at home. It's the worst avengers movie there is. Even the week of Ultron was better than this. A 12 year old could've written a better ending. Forced everything. 1st half is too slow and the 2nd half is too disappointing. I am not going to the cinema to watch Avengers for a reality check and get a headache. I am going there to get entertained. This wasn't even least entertaining. This was bloody depressing.
	
"I wasted 3 hours from my live. Captain Marvel was much more interesting. It is like this movie is done just to be released, i don't believe that initial idea for this movie is what we watch now."
	
"I am a huge Marvel fan and have loved the previous Avengers films so went with high Hope's for this, unfortunately I was disappointed beyond belief. Long, slow, dull scences make up most of the movie with only about 10 minutes of actual action. Main characters are sidetracked for less popular ones and the whole film moves at a snail's pace. It really felt like they had run out of ideas and this is just a money making film. So, so let down and would not recommend.. recommend it to anyone"
	
"Poor dubbing by Tamil.. horrible to see the movie...
Could have been better..
Worst dubbing...
Mismatch totally... everyone laughs for a serious scenes...."
	
"I saw Endgame Friday night. I might be a minority of one, but I hated it (and I am a big Marvel fan). The rules of time travel made absolutely no sense and were completely ad hoc, the tugs on the heart strings were gratuitous - a ritualistic bow to the currently fashionable trope that the stakes must be raised and there must be consequences - it's a comic book movie, for crying out loud! If I want to be depressed I can just read the newspaper! Modern filmmakers and script writers are embarrassed by straightforward happy endings and good triumphing over evil, even in superhero movies - witness the abomination that was Batman v. Superman or the way the recent Star Wars movies have completely undone the happy ending of Return of the Jedi (Han and Leia are divorced, Han's son kills his father, Luke is a bitter old hermit, etc.). The Russo brothers even said that they wanted their Avengers movies to be mature storytelling with real stakes and real consequences - i.e., we are going to kill off some beloved characters. Part of it is simply vanity (I don't make kids' movies - I engage in mature storytelling), but part of it is also a form of nihilistic cultural pessimism. It 's the same pessimism that makes it impossible for the heroes of any show to have a stable, solid romantic relationship like Jonathan and Jennifer in the old Hart to Hart TV show. Now it's all about the unresolved sexual tension stringing along the viewers for years, from Moonlighting to Lois and Clark to Castle to Lucifer. I also thought that the treatment of Thor as a caricature and a figure of comic relief verged on the obscene considering the aloof nobility of the character as he was initially conceived by Stan Lee. As for the time travel plot holes, I think the writers needed to use time travel to undo Thanos' snap, but they also wanted real consequences and real deaths that couldn't be undone (at least for the time being - you never know with superhero fiction!) So they decided that the heroes would go back in time to retrieve the Stones in order to undo the snap, but they also told us that going back in time would not change their present in the universe in which the action is taking place, except that it might create new timelines every time somebody interacts with the past,as the Ancient One tells Banner. If events other than the snap can't be undone (as they kept telling us), then the heroes created all sorts of new timelines even if they put the stones back at the time they first stole them: Howard Stark got a pep talk about parenting he wouldn't have gotten otherwise, Cap found out that Bucky was alive, etc. Most confusingly, was there a Steve Rogers married to Peggy Carter and a Steve Rogers frozen in ice at the same time in whatever timeline Cap created when he chose to stay in the past? And if so, what happened when Cap #1 was thawed out?The movie will probably make a ton of money, but it is a disappointing end to what had been a great run of movies"
	
"Continuity? 350M budget and no one looking over the continuity? Hair styles, braided beard..unbraided...braided again? You need special equipment and suits to time travel, but not the bad guys who follow? No one traveling through time ages except Captain America??? SO many dragged out scenes with 'on the nose' dialog. They only made it 3 hours long to give the impression it was 'epic' when it wasn't and isn't. Making Thor a laughing bafoon who gives up being king so he can continue being fat and lazy? If you can't kill your superheroes, turn them into rejects. They'll probably reboot all the characters like they did with Spiderman... again...and again...and again."
	
"This has to be one of the most overrated films I've ever seen, it was long boring and tiring to watch. The story was boring slow and at times just felt unnecessary. I genuinely don't understand how people can say it was a 10/10 film."
	
"I didn't like end game much. to long. to slow. to sloppy, to weak of a plot. to many cameos.thanos had to much physical power, all the other superheros got their power from outside sources, his was never explained. is it supposed to be his is born that way? even in infinity war he had to much physical strength. of which i didnt like the beginning of showing the end of 'thor, ragnorock, victorious ending being totally useless. a better ending and more tense/suspenseful scene would have been showing them fly off towards thanos ship in waiting.if thanos got his strength from some unnatural method, i missed that being explained. then why no others like him? comics say he is a titan. why no other titans?the key points in the movie's end fight scenes were far to subtle and why did iron man have to die because he used the glove? it was never explained. thanos never suffered using them, only destroying them. and so many others had it, why didn't they use it? even if it would kill them, whether they knew it would kill them or not, they could have ended it all instantly.the time travel thing was oh so sloppy. seems it was used only to go over the list of all the other movies. was more like a reunion documentary than an actual movie. bored the crap out of me. and the stupid mistakes made me upset.so now they have all the stones, with or without a glove, why did they need time travel machines to go back again to replace them? wouldnt the stones have let them do what they wanted to do, restoring any history they wished, one without thanos? and they could have brought back vision, why didnt they? etc etc etc.captain marvel was vastly wasted. so was her haircut. what was the point of that? she said she was needed elsewhere? who cares whats happening in the rest of the universe when its not going to matter after the glove puts it all back right. the only and the smartest thing about the movie was when thanos took her power stone to beat her. that was the best 10 seconds in the movie. but with that stone, they should have been equal. but then not equal because thanos isnt strong enough to smash entire ships by himself like captain marvel is. she is, without a doubt, by far the strongest character and that strength was not used.oh ya, that the glove just had to get back to him was such a joke of a cliche. again, should have been used before. the center point of the movie should have been making use of the glove by other means.thanos and the glove. he is smart enough to build a vast empire, yet he can only think to use the glove to kill. not to created a better method of existence without killing? he not so smart after all. and neither are any of the others for not suggesting something of that sort.the time travel thing should have put it all back right from the point of before thanos snapped fingers. should have gone back to the point where star lord should have shot thanos and ended it all, and then actually shoot him and end it all. of which that star lord didnt shoot him was the stupidest and weakest part of infinity wars. he was going to kill him but got so upset at him that he didnt kill him. huh? how does that work? who else would not have instantly shot thanos upon hearing such news?the only thing this movie was successful for was giving out as many paycheques as possible. the most cameos any movie ever had. did they really need to do that? showing 3 second clips at the end in the credits of each actor would have been better. at least less boring.they didnt just want to end the story line, they wanted to end my interest in it also. i watched them all just to make sure i didnt miss anything that might have been worth while. some of the others were just great. this one was far from it."
	
"Really?!?! 3 hours full of nothing? Storylines which took too long. Before all the parts came together, I almost walked out of the theater. Spend your money on a different film"
	
"After Infinity war I thought we would get a epic conclusion. That is no where near the case. I have no clue what the people rating it 10 watched, there must be two versions. This one movie pretty much ended my love of marvel films. And will be my likely be my last. Terrible writing ruined and killed off beloved charters. I like how Captain America was handled. But wrong person got shield. The movie was 2 and a half hours of garbage. With 30 minutes of ok action. Had a couple good moments but that's about it. What a huge let down from everyone involved. Save your money wait for it on Redbox."
	
"It was an disappointment! That's all i can say !
Absolute trash"
	
This film is 181min long and only 5min are good. The rest is just boring...
	
"So I recently read a book on what not to do when you write a story and this film did all of those things.First the movie takes over 40 minutes to actually start. Before Scott lang joins the gang, nothing happens except some Dialoge exchange but nothing really important that could have been done otherwiseSecond the characters don't have an arc wich is really important, characters like banner and stark don't have one, they don't learn something essentialy new to their character traits.
Thor has a somewhat arc but it seems very setup like in a children's cartoon.Also they bloss over many things that where set up in the previous movies, like only the infinity gauntlet can hold the infinity stones or only very strong carries can even hold one stone let alone the entire gauntletAnd the time travel aspect was pretty weird, first they go with the two time stream and then sometimes the only one time stream then two time streams again and so on.
Also they don't really explain what the problem with timetravel is.
Banner just mumbles something that nobody understood and baam that was it.BTW I find it pretty funny that stark wants a spectral reading of a quantom experiment......the problem is that light is made out of quantom particles, it is like feeling for atoms with your finger.Also Thanos wasn't a real thread any more, he was just a bad guy the fight, the terror that came with him in infinity war is complitly gone they just fight him.Also gamora past traveled into the future was pretty overplayed they could have done so much more with that but they only used her to get the ship from Thanos to earth and blow up the Avengers head quarters.....she could have easily get the stones and try to travel back but the avengers stop her and then Thanos sends the ship for help.This film has so many more issues but I don't want to write over 10.000 words on this.
This film is a disaster because it felt like a kids cartoon and not a propped ending to the Thanos Era.
So many mistakes could have been prevented but I think that the producers are to blame.You can see in some places that there are story writings aspect and character arcs involved but the producers probably didn't want that.
Those arcs involve taking a risk and that could ruin their franchise.
So they stuck with cheap jokes and no character arcs what so ever.
And the arcs they put in felt very very very arbitrary and didn't really stick with the audience."
	
"I understand that people really likes the movie, but in no world this movies is better or as great as the godfather, the dark night or pulp fiction. You all are overrating this movie."
	
Boring rehashed rubbish. Too long! Too many characters again!! Seen it all before and now I am bored of Marvel and DISNEY!!!!
	
I hate to see iron man in this movie frankly because of his real life character.
	
"I have to be honest I found that this movie left me wanting is so many ways. I both liked and disliked the way the hulk progressed in it.. I mean he went from angry savage to bulked up scientist .. as a result he had very lil to contribute to the movies other then comic relief. Thor was no different.. they turned the once noble and proud warrior into a fat simpering slob. Who also was lil more then comic relief.. if that The fact is that the whole movie really could have been done with out those two characters involved really. and almost was. Their roles were both so down played as a result that I am not sure the movie goers would have missed their presence in the movie. As far as Captain America and Iron man goes I found their actions predictable. The Captain Never liked being in the future... and Tony was always looking to prove to the world that he was a true hero.. and would pay the ultimate price. I was sad to see the character die but I did see it coming.
As far as Hawkeye and Black Widow go well I would like to have seen it go the other way to be honest as I rather liked the Black Widow character.
I enjoyed the growth of the characters of both nebula and gamora..
As for all the others a great many weren't even in the movie until the last 10 or so Minutes.As for the story line.. I well I found it lacking in a major way not to mention their premise behind their use of the gems... they didn't want to lose anything gained over the years.. but at the same time bring back all those lost due to Thanos. It quite literally made zero no sense I mean its kind of impossible. Its a major paradox and the truth is Tony Stark would have know that and as a result I cant see how he or anyone else in the team that would have known that would have or could have gone along with any of it. As such a thing would have been potentially more dangerous to reality then Thanos ever was or could be."
	
"Most cringe worthy superhero movie I've seen.
I was eye-rolling most of the time. Near the end I was just hoping for it to finally end.
I mean, where to begin, is totally messy and nonsensical! All the time travel doesn't make sense at all.
After all the hype I'm so mad at how bad it was."
	
"I think giving this film a 2 was being kind. Iv rarely been so excited to watch a film and to say I feel let down is an understatement. It's hard to know where to start as theres so many flaws in this film. The film feels rushed which is unbelievable for a film that's 3hours long but you could of fit the first hour and half in 10minutes. I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing, the film was that boring. The whole time travel is just a complete mess and how easy were the avengers able to get all the stones, that was a joke. In regards to the battle at the end it was ok but it's almost like the writers wanted it to be this big iconic battle that people would be talking about for years but that fell flat too. This films been 10 years in the waiting and 21 films later and to end like that was just poor...So poor."
	
"Failure with no purpose , and the rating is all about fans"
	
"Also watched GoT season 8 episode 3 (the long night*) after Endgame;
let's just say I completely forgot about this final avengers movie. Literally that episode of GOT blows this movie away.MANY of the scenes weren't important/forgettable. Infinity War was just better, whatever the Russo brothers were ready to retire, therefore comic movies are going back to being crap.ITS OVER, MCU as we know it will be feminized by Disney and going down the crapper. It was fun while it lasted, btw Captain Marvel is HORRIBLE, the movie, character, everything. Great new dyke haircut."
	
"The people how got these job got overwelmed and starter messing up every single thing, they stetched the movie to nowhere, leading to events that don't make any sense... true fans will feel that this was a kick in the stomach... I'm just disapointed.Simply a spit on Stan Lee's grave."
	
"Never ever use timetravel to resolve or fix anything, when you start to see or use timetravel to fix the past then you enter uncharted land where anything is possible if it make sense or not.So you killed my father I will timetravel to kill your father that you dont get born but hey cant you timetravel to kill my father so I dont get born but why you then want to kill my father?Can we sure that every change in the past will not split a new present so no matter what I fix in the past it wont change my present thus creating another present where I habe no access too.This can go on and on and on so even this movie could play 24h each solution for anyhing can be changed and unfixed with next time travel step.For this movie I can say only no matter how it ends who knows if in next movie some timetravel will unwind and we are square one or in just random mess.Because of timetravel you must disconnect to anything because no matter what happens it can be rewinded and changed with a complete different outcome.I am glad I didnt have to pay money for thiss mess."
	
"Loved, LOVED Infinity War...
End Game on the other hand was utter trash.
I cannot believe the Russo's directed both.
I regret not walking out. The thought crossed my mind at least 3 different times."
	
"With the hype i just ran to watch the show on the second day itself... But it made me some anger in my nerves by the end..even its all fantasy there should be some justice for what they showing... Firstly whoever giving big hype please answer my following points..
1. In earlier version of avengers (infinity stones) thor was after creating a weapon to fight thanos and by the end he used it where thanos can resist it even with gauntlet stones power, here in this even without any gauntlet or stones the same weapon can do nothing ...just throwing here and there ,Thats it ! (now y did captain america can use it ! They desimatted the character thor , helpless powerless guy )
2. After all that fight with thanos all together, no one even cannot move the gauntlet from his hand (remember not single handed, tried by many characters all together in earlier version too) then how come tony stark can go and replace the gauntlet, that too single handed..(this is very important because its the main end scene of the fight)..atleast they could use support of captain marvel to make it more believable but they just thrown that character too away...
After all how come captain marvel and thor are powerless characters and iron man / captain america powerful characters ? Basically this movie is made for that !"
	
"Do not watch this film unless you are a Marvel die hard fan or you want to fall asleep. Contains 3 hours of boring sentimental dialogues, 1 fighting scene and makes infinity war look like Space Odyssey. Waste of time."
	
If u r a marvel emotional fan then the film is for you don't have too much expectations like previous marvel movies
	
"It is so easy to criticize this movie because of its countless plot holes (I stopped counting them after the first 30 minutes), logical flaws, cheesy music, surprisingly bad CGI and the usual Disney ideology. Humanity has reached a point where only train wrecks like these can make billions of dollars. The most striking point however is that you can only understand Avengers: Endgame if you have seen all Marvel movies, believe it or not. It's a movie for fanboys only that live in their own universe which gives them a false sense of superiority while the opposite is actually true. It has happened: Fanboys which operate on the same level as sports fans have hijacked to art form of moving pictures in order to create their own, perpetually self-referential, anti-intellectual universe. It's a sad time for true movie lovers."
	
Watched midnight show here in Dubai.. Seriously the movie sucks big time.. I didnt like a bit.
	
"I found the story and the rhythm of the movie so messy, slow and boring. Really expected more."
	
"Unnecessary emotions, focus on only Captain America and Iron man, Role of Thor is just for joke."
	
"Right in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point.
In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements...
The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on.
Alls well that ends well. Except we spent 3 hours to find that out."
	
"The film I was looking forward to the most following on from the epic masterclass of infinity war comes End Game - an utter disappointment. The film felt far too rushed I would have rather wait 3/4 years for it to be done right. Far too many silly jokes, the film wasn't taken seriously enough, not enough action or strong points. 3 hour film all built up for 30 minutes worth watching.The film was a let down from the off.. Hulk turned into mr nice guy and never returned to being the angry hulk we all love, captain America was able to wield thors Hammer and then wield his power of lighting? Thanos seemed to be more powerful as without the gauntlet as no one seemed to be able to inflict any damage fighting him even with the power of Captain Marvel and the mighty God of Thunder.I felt this was to be the perfect way to end the Avengers but unfortunately it really was not and it saddens me to write this.."
	
This not a good movie. Ant man and wasp was a good movie. It is very badly written. Dam you people killing of Iron Man. Kill of black widow shame on you. It good to have humor the problem is that it not good humor at all. Turning Captain America into an old man dam you all.
	
"Utter crap - left the theater upset and exhausted.
I hate everything about Brie Larson - she's ruining Marvel for me.
Best character development for Thanos completely destroyed. Don't even get me started on Thor.
Give 2 and not 1 for Cap and Stark."
	
"First how Hulk not healing and wearing a hand strap after using the stones...!? I hated the new character of hulk that he is not smashing and full of anger, so ridiculous. Second how Capten America lift Thor's hammer and started to use it as it's his hammer with thunderbolts? So weird. How Capten America gave away his armor to Falcon? I can't imagine Falcon flying and holding the Armor. This is disaster."
	
"I've expected much more as it was the final chapter but to be honest infinity war was much more interesting and mind banding, the story happened in the end game I expected them almost all of them before watching the movie so I was waiting to be proved wrong and get excited unfortunately I wasn't, End game was more emotional rather than interesting, they paid too much attention to viewers satisfaction they did what emotional viewers would have wanted.End of the story"
	
"Far too long and uninteresting. No character development. Pacing between large battles and dialogues way off, making both of them equally boring and drawn out."
	
A big disappointment for Thor fans. Intentionally made him dummy and useless. No other Avenger has such a great screen presence than Thor and this was intentionally ruined in the movie. Was expecting till the end for Thor to come back in this movie. It was totally stupid to make Thor like this.
	
"Such a disappointment. They over hyped it. Too many plot holes that gave us more questions in the end. Russo brothers dropped the ball big in this one. No elaboration on the ancient one, doctor strange, hulk doesn't fight anyone, Loki disappears, and you never hear anything about vision. This movie made me cringe. If you follow the comics and a true fan of the movies then you will be lost. If you don't follow it like that then you are going to be as lost as you have ever been in any movie. This seems like the fall of the MCU."
	
I don't like character thor and hulk and more Drama
	
"Worst than Batman VS Superman
infinity war is better than this movie, please bring back my money !!!!!"
	
"This movie is pure awesomeness. This is a movie, i will be remembered for eternity.
Just a big thanks. Cinema was never so much entertaining.
Can't wait for blu ray disk"
	
"Such a let down & huge disappointment! Infinity War was beyond amazing & perfectly setup for the best ending anyone could ever imagine, until you see this movie. I can't believe the Russo Brothers willingly destroyed our favorite characters we have been built up to love & cherish all these years. The plot holes are continuous & the only thing you learn to count on in this flick. The 1st half is boring & dragged out only to later have nano seconds with the anxiously awaited returned. Such a waste & felt like being robbed of those moments you couldn't wait to see! Beloved Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow and Hulk are all ruined!! The charisma & pizazz is sucked out from all of them. Felt like it was written to only care about Captain America & Hawkeye. There are very few cool moments because it leaves you confused & wanting answers to the new plot holes. Unnecessary deaths & destruction end this era of fine films in to depression & just a ton more questions you feel you deserve answers to after being so loyal & attached. This was supposed to wrap things up & feel like an ending. Nope!"
